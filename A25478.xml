            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Live up to what you have attained, and you may be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent that what is further wanting, God will, as you want it, ſupply it. Be aſſur'd of this, that you will get more skill and ſtrength for all neceſſary Graces and Duties by an humble, ſerious, conſtant Courſe of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than you poſſibly can do by captious Criticiſmes, and wrangling Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions about leſſer things, in which too many ſpend their Lives.

            <p>This Command you have in <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy might.</hi> This Command is not found in <hi>Exodus,</hi> nor in <hi>Leviticus,</hi> but only in <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> i. e. the ſecond Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> which as ſome expreſs it, bore a Type of the ſecond Law, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Evangelical,</hi> to which this Command is proper; for the Old Law was a Law of <hi>fear</hi> tending to bondage, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Moſes</hi> mentions the incuſſion of terror in the giving of it, which when he hath diſpatch'd, he begins the following Chapter with <hi>Love,</hi> noting, that the Holy Ghoſt will cauſe the Law of <hi>Love,</hi> to ſucceed the Law of <hi>Fear.</hi> And 'tis obſervable that the <hi>Jews</hi> read this place with the higheſt obſervation: and their Scribes write the firſt and laſt words of the Preface to it with greater Letters than ordinary, to amplifie the ſenſe, and to note that this is the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and the end of the Divine Law; and they read this Scripture morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening with great<note n="*" place="margin">

            <p>The occaſion of Chriſt's preſſing this command upon them at this time was this; when the Phariſees heard how he had baffled the Sadduces, and ſtopped their mouths, with ſo proper and fit an anſwer, that they had no more to ſay, they conſult how they may ſhew their <hi>acumen</hi> and ſharpneſs of wit, to dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Chriſt's credit concerning his Doctrine, and Skill in Scripture; and therefore they chuſe out one of their moſt accompliſh'd Interpreters of the Law, captiouſly to propoſe an excellent queſtion. They call him <hi>Maſter,</hi> whoſe Diſciples they will not be: they enquire after the <hi>Great</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:95740:5"/> who will not duely obſerve the <hi>leaſt:</hi> they thought Chriſt could not return ſuch an anſwer, but that they might very plauſibly except againſt it.<note n="*" place="margin">Cartw.

Though the excellency of the ſubject calls for the enlargement of your hearts, yet the copiouſneſs of it requires the contracting of my diſcourſe.

            <p n="1">1. What is it to love God with all the heart, ſoul, and mind? We muſt not be too curious in diſtinguiſhing theſe words: the ſame thing is meant, when the words are uſed ſingly; as<note n="a" place="margin">1 King. 14.8.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> is ſaid to follow God <hi>with all his heart:</hi> and doubly;<note n="b" place="margin">2 King. 23.3.</note> 
               <hi>Joſiah</hi> made his people (as well as himſelf) to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant <hi>to walk after the Lord with all their heart, and all their ſoul:</hi> and where three words are uſed; as<note n="c" place="margin">Deut. 6 5.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind:</hi> and when four words are uſed; as<note n="d" place="margin">Mark 12.30.</note> 
               <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God, with all thine heart, and with all thy ſoul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy ſtrength.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Love to God muſt go through, and poſſeſs our whole nature and all the powers of it. The mind muſt think of God: the will muſt delight in God; in ſhort,<note n="e" place="margin">Bucer.</note> our whole ſtrength muſt be employ'd to pleaſe him. We muſt love nothing more than God, nothing equal with God; we muſt love God above all, and that for himſelf; but all other things in God, and for God. We muſt be willing to loſe all; yea, life it ſelf, rather than to admit any thing contrary to the love of God.<note n="*" place="margin">Gerhard Harm.</note> All theſe expreſſions denote the intenſneſs of our affections, the unexpreſſibleneſs of our obligation, and the contemptible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of every thing that ſhall challenge a ſhare in our love. All theſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions admoniſh us of our infirmity, provoke us to humility, and ſet us a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after a better life. 'Tis a notable expreſſion of one<note n="g" place="margin">Auth. imperſ. operis.</note> 
               <hi>The love of the heart is not underſtood, but felt; the love of the ſoul is not felt, but underſtood;
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:95740:5"/> becauſe the love of the ſoul is its judgment: He that loves God as he is here commanded, believes that all good is in God, and that God is all that is good; and that without God there is</hi> no <hi>good: he believes that God is All Power, and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and that without God there's neither Power, nor Wiſdom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all that hath been ſpoken, no doubt but there is a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular <hi>emphaſis</hi> in the words; and the Holy Ghoſt intends a more full declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>manner</hi> of our love, by theſe ſeveral expreſſions. Though to be over-critical in the diſtinguiſhing of theſe words, will rather intricate, than explicate this great command; yet to follow a plain Scriptural interpretation will give light into the duty.</p>
            <p>Let's enquire therefore, 1. What it is to love. 2. What it is to love God. 3. What it is to love God in that manner here expreſs'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is love? <hi>Love is an affection of union, whereby we deſire,</hi>

            <p>It is not a <hi>carnal</hi> love I am now to ſpeak of; the <hi>Philoſopher</hi> could obſerve, that there can be no true love among wicked men.</p>
            <p>It is not a <hi>natural</hi> love, for that may as well be brutiſh, as rational; and divine love is tranſcendently rational.</p>
            <p>It is not a (meerly) <hi>moral</hi> love, for that conſiſts in a <hi>mean,</hi> but divine love is alwayes in an <hi>extream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Divine love is a compound of all the former, but it adds infinitely more to them, than it borrows of them. Divine love is ſupernaturally natural; it turns Moral virtues into Spiritual graces. It engageth men to attempt as much for the glorifying of God, as all the creatures beſides, from the higheſt Angel to the moſt inſenſible Stone.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What it is love to God? Methinks a lax deſcription beſt ſuits my deſign. This Divine love, 'tis the <hi>unſpeakable enlargement</hi> of the heart <hi>towards</hi> God:<note place="margin">What it is to love God.</note> 'tis the <hi>extaſie</hi> and <hi>raviſhment</hi> of the heart <hi>in</hi> God; 'tis the Soul's <hi>loſing</hi> its ſelf in God:
'tis the continual <hi>working</hi> of the heart towards God: every faculty of the Soul is actually engaged: The <hi>Mind</hi> is muſing and plodding how to pleaſe God, and enjoy him; the <hi>Will</hi> is graciouſly obſtinate, the policy of hell cannot charm it off it's object; the <hi>Affections</hi> are all <hi>Paſſions</hi> in their eager motions towards God; the <hi>Conſcience</hi> is a buſie-body neceſſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the whole man to a jealous watch. I ſaid this love 'tis the enlargement of the heart towards God; when the <hi>love of God is ſhed abroad in the heart,</hi> 'tis as the breaking of a Ball of lightning, it ſets all on a flame immediately. It is the <hi>unſpeakable</hi> enlargement of the heart towards God; the higheſt Rhetorick is too flat to expreſs it, as is obvious in that Song of <hi>Songs,</hi> that Song of <hi>loves.</hi> I have no way to ſet this out unto you, but by words, the plaineſt and moſt intelligible expreſſions I can give you, ſhall be by ſeveral ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>militudes, which I ſhall purſue till they leave me to admiration: I ſhall bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row Metaphors from things without life, from Plants, from ſenſitive Creatures, from Man.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

Chriſt gives the anſwer<note n="k" place="margin">John 10.28.29.</note>, their union with God, their enjoyment of God is inſeperable; and though they may (as ſometimes they will in their imperfect ſtate) have ſome warping on their parts, and ſome withdrawing on God's, yet their love to God, (in the loweſt ebbe) tremblingly hankers after him, the ſoul cannot forget its alone reſting-place<note n="l" place="margin">Pſal. 116.7.</note>

            <p n="2">2. Our Love to God is like the love of the <hi>Flower of the Sun</hi> to the Sun.

            <p n="3">3. Our Love to God is like the love of the <hi>Turtle</hi> to her Mate; God's People are his Turtle<note n="o" place="margin">Pſal. 74.19.</note>. I grant, they moſt properly reſemble Brotherly Love, but why not our Love to God? they never aſſociate with other Birds; the loving ſoul keeps fellowſhip with God, and (out of choice) with him only, and thoſe that bear his Image. The Turtle never ſings and flyes abroad for recreation as other birds, but they have a peculiar note for each other; the ſoul that loves God, flutters not about for worldly vanities; no recreation ſo ſweet as Communion with God; the Soul's converſe with God is peculiar.

The ſoul is here taken for the <hi>Animal</hi> life, which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:95740:7"/> both the Vegetative and Senſitive part. To love God with the ſoul is to ſubject all thoſe works that pertain to an <hi>Animal</hi> life, unto the love of God. Plainly and in ſhort, it is not enough to love God in our <hi>Will,</hi> but we muſt not admit any thing contrary to the Love of God in our <hi>ſenſual</hi> delights. Whatſoever ſenſualiſts do for the gratifying of their luſts and deſires, let thoſe things be drained from the dregs of ſin, and conſecrate them all unto God. Whatever uſe wicked men make of their ſouls, in a way of hatred of God, we muſt make the contrary uſe in a way of loving of God. And then,</p>

               <note place="margin">What it is to love God with all the ſoul.</note> we muſt be ready to lay down our lives for God<note n="d" place="margin">Origen.</note>: if any one ſhould be ask'd what in all the world was moſt dear unto him, he would anſwer his life; for life-ſake tender Mothers have caſt off the ſence of Nature, and fed upon their own children. It is Life that affords us being, ſenſe, motion, underſtanding, riches, dominions. If a man had the Empire of the World, he could enjoy it no longer than he hath his ſoul in his body, when that is gone, he preſently becomes a horrid Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kaſs, or rather a loathſom dunghil. Now then if a man love his Life ſo much, why ſhould he not love God more, by whom he lives, and from whom he expects greater things than this Life? God is the ſoul of our ſoul, and the life of our life, he is nearer to us than our very ſouls<note n="e" place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note>; <hi>in him we live, and move, and have our being.</hi> He that doth but indifferently weigh theſe things, will acknowledge that it is no raſhneſs to call that man a <hi>Monſter</hi> that loves not God; how then can we think of it without grief, that the whole world is full of theſe <hi>Monſters;</hi> almoſt all men prefer their Money, or Pleaſures, or their Honours, or their luſts before God. So oft as you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly break any Law of God to raiſe your Credit or Eſtate, you prefer the dirt and duſt of the world before God: Alas! what uſe do's a wicked man make of his ſoul, but to ſerve his body? whereas both ſoul and body ſhould be wholly taken up with, not only the ſervice, but the love of God. Then may you be ſaid to love God with all your ſouls, when your whole Life is filled with the love of God, when your worldly buſineſs truckles under the love of God; the love of the deareſt Relations ſhould be but hatred, when compared with your love to God. When you eat and drink to the glory of God, ſleep no more than may make you ſerviceable unto God; when your ſolitary muſings are about the engaging your ſouls to God, when your ſocial Conference is about the things of God; when all acts of Worſhip endear God to you; when all your Duties bring you nearer to God; when the love of God is the ſweetneſs of your Mercies, and your Cordial under Afflictions, when you can love God under amazing Providences, as well as under re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing Deliverances; then you may be ſaid to love God with all your Souls.</p>

God created us, and gave us our Being, but we can do nothing like this for God; God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves us in ſafety, and daily confers innumerable Benefits upon us; God delivers from innumerable dangers both of Soul and Body: there's none of all this to be done for God; God is infinitely above all ſuch Returns; and
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:95740:8"/> there are other things wherein we may not render God like for like. If God be angry with us, we may not be angry with him: if he reprove us, we muſt not quarrel with him: if God judge us, we muſt not cenſure him: But now God loves us, and through Grace we are able to love him again; and he loves us, and God commands us to love him again. 'Tis true, there's no equality between God's loving of us, and our loving of God. God's Love does infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely overcome ours<note n="t" place="margin">Raymundus.</note>: but yet our love to God ſpeaks Intereſt and Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the thing loved gives the name to the love: Love is but an indifferent Paſſion, till it be united to the thing loved, and then it gets a denomination; <hi>e. g.</hi> If the Object be earthly, it is an earthly love; if ſenſual, it is a brutiſh love; if it be man, 'tis an humane love; if God, 'tis a Divine love; ſo that by our love we are changed and transformed into a thing more noble, or more vile; we therefore debaſe our ſelves in loving any thing but God, there's nothing elſe worthy of our love; whatſoever we love, we give it a kind of dominion over us, ſo that the will loſeth its dignity and excellency when it loves inferiour things: we are as it were married to that we love. <hi>Suppoſe</hi> (ſaith <hi>Raymundus) a poor man of mean ſtock, and no reputation, have ſix daughters; they are all equal by birth, as to reputation and eſteem, but they are all differenced by their marriage; the eldeſt marries a Farmer, the next a Citizen, the third a Knight, the fourth a Duke, the fifth a King, the ſixth at Emperour; by theſe marriages there's a very great inequality: So here, by the Object of your love you are dignified or debaſed.</hi> But there is more yet in God's being the Object of our Love: <hi>thou ſhalt love the Lord</hi> [thy God] <hi>thy God,</hi> and therefore thou muſt love him. Give me leave to enlarge a little on this, and I will be the briefer in the other Conſiderations, how this is the great Command, thou ſhalt love the Lord <hi>Thy God.</hi> Thoſe things that are ours, though they are not alwayes lovely, yet we love them; our own Children, whether of our Bodies or our Minds, our own Eſtates: we are more troubled at the loſs of any thing wherein our own Propriety is concerned, than in all the World beſides; a ſmall thing of our own is a thouſand times more to us, than a thouſand times as much of anothers: we are more concern'd for the cutting off our own Finger, than the cutting off another mans Head: Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty doth exceedingly heighten Love. But then when there is a <hi>ſpecialty</hi> upon the Propriety, that it is impoſſible to have the want repair'd, <hi>e. g. my</hi> Child, and mine <hi>onely</hi> Child. Whatever you ſay of God, you may put an <hi>onely</hi> to it: God ſo loves every gracious Soul, as if he had no other Perſon to beſtow his Love upon, therefore thou muſt ſo love God, as if there were nothing elſe in the world to beſtow thy love upon. Alas! what's thine to day as to outward things, may be none of thine to morrow: thou canſt not ſay ſo of God; God <hi>once</hi> thine, and <hi>for ever</hi> thine. But perhaps you will ſay, <hi>Were God mine, you ſhould need to ſay no more to inflame my heart to love him. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in God! could I attain this, I had enough. This is it I wait for, I pray for; I think nothing too much for it; I onely fear I ſhall never attain it; the very comforts of my Life are imbitter'd for want of it.</hi> To this I anſwer, we cannot ſhake off God's Soverainty over us nor Propriety in us, this you will grant: God is and will be, Thy God, Thy Lord, thy Sovereign, Thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, let thy carriage be what it will; the vileſt wretches in the World,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:95740:9"/> cannot ſin themſelves from under God's dominion. <hi>But there's no comfort in this:</hi> Well then, I will therefore add, thou that mourneſt after propriety in God, God is thy God; thy gracious God, and Father; thy God in Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; thy God in mercy; and loving kindneſs.

            <p>Imped. 3. <hi>Spiritual ſloath,</hi> and careleſſneſs of Spirit, when men do not trouble themſelves about Religion, nor any thing that is ſerious. Love is a buſie paſſion, a buſie grace; love among the paſſions, is like Fire among the Elements; Love among the Graces, is like the Heart among the Members; now that which is moſt contrary to the nature of love, muſt needs moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct the higheſt actings of it; the truth is, a careleſs frame of Spirit, is fit for nothing; a ſluggiſh, lazy, ſlothful, careleſs perſon never attains to any excellency in any kind; what is it you would intruſt a lazy perſon about? let me ſay this, and pray think on't twice, e're you cenſure it once; <hi>Spiritual ſloath doth Chriſtians more miſchief, than ſcandalous relapſes.</hi> I grant their groſſer falls may be worſe as to others, the grieving of the Godly, and the hardning of the wicked, and the Reproach to Religion muſt needs be ſo great, as may make a gracious heart tremble at the thought of falling; but yet as to themſelves a ſloathful temper is far more prejudicial, <hi>e. g.</hi> thoſe gracious perſons that fall into any open ſin, 'tis but once, or ſeldom in their

Sloath (I may rather call it unſpiritual ſloath) is a ſoft moth in our ſpiritual wardrobe; a corroding ruſt in our ſpiritual Armory; an enfeebling conſumption in the very vitals of Religion. <hi>Sloath and careleſſneſs without an Epithete, bare ſloath without any thing to aggravate it, ordinarily doth the Soul more hurt, than all the Devils in hell, yea, than all its other ſins.</hi> Shake off this, and then you will be more than Conquerors over all other difficulties; ſhake off this, and there is but one ſin (that I can think of at preſent) that you'l be in danger of, and that's <hi>ſpiritual pride.</hi> You'l thrive ſo faſt in all grace, you'l grow up into ſo much communion with God, that unleſs God ſometimes withdraw to keep you humble, you will have a very Heaven upon Earth.</p>

            <p>Imped. 5. <hi>Inordinate love of things lawful,</hi> and in ſome reſpect here's our greateſt danger; here perſons have Scripture to plead for their love to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons, and things; that it is a duty to beſtow ſome love upon them, and the <hi>meer</hi> ſtones are not ſo plainly ſet, as eaſily to diſcern the utmoſt bounds of what is lawful, and the firſt ſtep into what is ſinful, and here having ſome plauſible pretences for the parcelling out of their love, they plead not guilty, though they love not God with all their hearts, ſouls, and minds, whereas they ſhould conſider that the beſt of the world is not for <hi>enjoyment</hi> but <hi>uſe;</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:95740:12"/> not our <hi>end,</hi> but <hi>means</hi> conducing to our chief end. <hi>Here's our ſin, and our miſery, our fooliſh tranſplacing of end, and means:</hi> Men make it their end to eat, and drink, and get eſtates, and injoy their delights, and what reſpect they have to God (I know not whether to call love or Service) they ſhew it but as means to flatter God, to gratifie them in their pitiful ends.</p>
            <p>Having warned you of ſome of the chief Impediments, I ſhall propoſe ſome means to engage your hearts in love to God, which you may confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently expect to be effectual through the operation of the Holy Ghoſt, and you may likewiſe expect the operation of the Spirit in the uſe of ſuch means.</p>
            <p>The means are either <hi>Directing, Promoting,</hi> or <hi>Conſerving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Means to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain love to God.</note>1. <hi>Directing,</hi> and that is <hi>Spiritual Knowledge,</hi> this is beyond what can be ſpoken in its commendation: A clear and diſtinct knowledge of the love and lovelineſs of God in the amazing, yet raviſhing methods of its manifeſtations, and the clear underſtanding of the heavenly priviledge of having our hearts inflam'd with love to God, this will do — (I would fain perſwade you to try,) I am not able to ſay how much, to direct you in this caſe; plainly get, and exerciſe this twofold knowledge.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The knowledge of Spiritual things; did we but perfectly know the Nature of the moſt contemptible inſect; nay, did we but know the Nature of Atoms, this would lead us to admire and love God; but then to know thoſe things that no graceleſs perſon in the world cares for the knowledge of, <hi>e. g.</hi> the inward workings of Original Sin, <hi>and how to undermine it;</hi> the powerful workings of the Spirit of grace, <hi>and how to improve it;</hi> what are the joys of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>and how to obtain them;</hi> would not ſuch things inſinuate the love of God into you? add then,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The knowledge of ordinary things in a Spiritual manner, ſo as to make the knowledge of Natural things ſerve Heavenly deſigns. Thus Chriſt in all the Metaphors, in all the Parables he uſed. To value no knowledge any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than it is reducible to ſuch an uſe, this would lead us into the loving of God. Thus I name but one directing means, promoting means are various, not but that Spiritual knowledge doth ſingularly promote the love of God, but it's proper work lyes in directing. The ſeveral things I ſhall name for <hi>inward</hi> means, your way of managing muſt make them ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Self-denyal,</hi> this is ſo neceſſary, that no other grace can ſupply the want of it. It is among the graces of the Soul, as among the members of the Body, one member may ſupply the want of another, the defect of the Lungs may be ſupplied by other parts. The want of prudence may be ſupplied with Goſpel-ſimplicity, which looks like quite another thing; but nothing can ſupply our want of love to God; nor can any thing ſupply our want of Self-denyal in order to our loving of God.

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Contempt of the world.</hi> As love of the world is a great impediment, ſo contempt of the world is a great promoter of our love to God; may not our contempt of the world be beſt expreſs'd by our worldly diffidence? we have no confidence in it, no expectation of happineſs from it. I take both the underſtanding and will to be the ſeat of Faith; now to have both theſe againſt the world, is to have our underſtanding ſatisfied, that the world cannot ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie us; to look upon the world as <hi>an empty Drum,</hi> that makes a great noiſe, but hath nothing in it; and therefore the will doth not hanker after it, hath no kindneſs for it. That perſon is a good proficient in divine love, that can make the world ſerviceable to devotion; by drawing arguments from his worldly condition, be it what it will, to promote piety, <hi>e. g.</hi> Have I any thing conſiderable in the world? I will manage it as a Steward, bleſſed be God he hath entruſted me with any thing, whereby I may ſhew my love to him, in my love to his. Have I nothing in the world? Bleſſed be God for my freedom from worldly ſnares; God knows I need food and raiment, and I am of <hi>Jacob</hi>'s mind<note n="p" place="margin">Gen. 28.20, 21.</note>, if God will give me no more, he ſhall be my God, and I will be content <hi>whatever my condition be in the world, 'tis better than Chriſt's was; and Oh that I could love God as Chriſt did!</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Obſervation of God's benefits to us,</hi> 'tis goodneſs and beneficence that draws out love; God is our infinite Benefactor, the very brutes love their Benefactors<note n="q" place="margin">
                  <hi>Iſa. 1.3.</hi> Qui beneficia inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit, compedes invenit. <hi>Sen.</hi>
               </note>. <hi>The Ox knoweth his owner, and the Aſs his Maſter's crib, but my people doth not conſider.</hi> Who can reckon up the benefits he receives from God? the commoneſt of our mercy deſerves a return of love, how much more our Spiritual merces? thoſe very mercies that are <hi>troubleſome</hi> to us, deſerve our love, <hi>e. g. Trouble for Sin</hi> though to a degree of horror; <hi>hungring after Chriſt,</hi> though unto languiſhing; <hi>diſappointments in the world,</hi> though without ſatisfaction any where elſe; <hi>lamenting after God,</hi> though with fear we ſhall never enjoy him: Such like <hi>throws</hi> of anguiſh make way for <hi>ſpiritual</hi> joy, and comfort; and the Soul that goes through ſuch exerciſes, grows in love to God every day. As for other kinds of Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, I'le ſay but this, God doth more for us every hour of our lives, than all our deareſt Friends, or Relations on Earth, than all the Saints and Angels in Heaven can do, ſo much as once, ſhould they do their utmoſt: and can you do leſs than love him?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Watchfulneſs over our own hearts.</hi> When we love God, we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that we love a jealous God. This will reſtrain the ſtragling of our affections: we ſhould keep as careful a watch over our own hearts, as we ſhould over a rich Heireſs, committed to our Guardianſhip; we reckon ſhe's undone, and we ſhall never be able to look God or Man in the face, if ſhe be unworthily match'd through our default. Chriſtians, your hearts through the condeſenſion of God, and Blood and Spirit of Chriſt, are a match for the King of Glory: ſeveral inferiour objects not worth the naming, are earneſt ſuitors; we are undone if any but God have our Supream love; if you be not ſeverely watchful, this heart of yours will be ſtoln away: be perſwaded therefore to examine every thing that you have cauſe to ſuſpect: call your
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:95740:13"/> ſelves often to an account; be jealous of your hearts, and of every thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by you may be endangered.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Prayer.</hi> All manner of Prayer is ſingularly uſeful to enflame the heart with love to God. <hi>Thoſe that pray beſt, love God beſt:</hi> miſtake me not, I do not ſay thoſe that can pray with the moſt florid expreſſions; or thoſe that can pray with the moſt general applauſe; but they that moſt feel every word they ſpeak, and every thought they think in Prayer: they whoſe apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God are moſt over-whelming; whoſe affections to God are moſt Spiritually paſſionate; whoſe Prayers are moſt wreſtling, and graciouſly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent, this is the man that prayes beſt, and loves God beſt. I grant theſe are the Prayers of a great proficient in the love of God, but you may pray <hi>for</hi> this frame when you cannot pray <hi>with</hi> it. The Soul never falls ſick of divine love in Prayer, but Chriſt preſently gives it an extraordinary viſit<note n="(r)" place="margin">Cant. 2.5, 6.</note>, ſo ſoon as ever Chriſt's Spouſe ſayes, ſhe is <hi>ſick of love,</hi> the next words ſhe ſpeaks are, that <hi>his left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me.</hi> Compare that with thoſe words<note n="(s)" place="margin">Cant. 6 5:</note>, <hi>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me:</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks as of being overcome and conquer'd. Rouze up your ſelves therefore, give your ſelves unto Prayer, Pray for a more Spiritual diſcovery of Gods amiableneſs, did you <hi>know</hi> God better, you could not but <hi>love</hi> him more; and none can diſcover God to us, as he diſcovers himſelf, ſo ſpiritually, ſo powerfully; take no denyal, God will never be angry with your being importunate for hearts to love him.</p>

               <q>O my God, it is thy ſelf I love above all things; 'tis for thy ſelf, in thee my deſires are terminated; and therefore what wilt thou give me? if thou wilt not give me thy ſelf, thou wilt give me nothing. If I find thee not, I find nothing; thou doſt not at all reward me, but vehemently torment me: heretofore when I ſought thee finally, for thy ſelf, I hop'd that I ſhould quickly find thee, and keep thee, and with this ſweet hope I comforted my ſelf in all my labours; but now if thou deny me thy ſelf, what wilt thou give me? ſhall I be for ever diſappointed of ſo great a hope? ſhall I always languiſh in my love? ſhall I mourn in my languiſhment? ſhall I grieve in my mourning? ſhall I weep and wail in my grief? ſhall I alwayes be empty? ſhall I alwayes diſconſolately ſorrow? inceſſantly complain, and be endleſly tormented? O my moſt good, moſt powerful, moſt merciful, and moſt lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, thou doſt not uſe ſo unfriendly and like an enemy to deſpiſe, refuſe, wound and torment thoſe that love thee with all their heart, ſoul, and ſtrength; that hope for full happineſs in thee. Thou art the God of truth, the beginning and end of thoſe that love thee, thou doſt at laſt give thy ſelf to thoſe that love thee, to be their perfect and compleat happineſs.

            <p n="6">6. <hi>Meditation.</hi> A duty as much talk'd of, and as little practis'd as any duty of Chriſtianity. Did you but once a day [In that time of the day, which upon experience you find to be fitteſt for ſuch a work] ſolemnly place your ſelves in Gods preſence; beg of him the fixing and the flowing of your
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:95740:13"/> thoughts, that your thoughts might be graciouſly fix'd, yet as graciouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd; let the ſubject matter of them be ſomething Spiritual, endeavour to fill your heads, and affect your hearts with holy muſings, till you come to ſome reſolution, which reſolution cloſe with Prayer, and follow with endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours. O how would this (even e're you are aware) engage your Souls to love God, though you cannot methodize your Meditations to your mind, yet inure your ſelves to an holy thoughtfulneſs about things above. Endeavour as you are able, to tye your thoughts together, and ſo faſten them that they may not be loſt, that your muſing time may not be reckon'd among your loſt time. I diſtinguiſh between <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Study:</hi> Study is for knowledge, Meditation is for Grace: <hi>Study</hi> leaves every thing as we find it; <hi>Meditation</hi> leaves a Spiritual impreſs upon every thing it meddles with.

Chriſtians, this you know, there muſt be a forſaking of all wicked company, e're you can pretend the leaſt love to Chriſt, (miſtake me not) I do not mean that the bonds of Family-relations muſt preſently be broken, that Husbands and Wives, Parents and Children, Maſters and Covenant-ſervants muſt preſently ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, if one of them be ungodly; No, where the relation is ſuch, as can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be diſſolved without ſin; then thoſe that are Godly, muſt converſe with the ungodly, as Phyſicians with their ſick patients. But this is it I ſay, <hi>you muſt not willingly and out of choice make Gods Enemies your familiar Friends.</hi> Thoſe that are alwayes ſpeaking well of God, inſenſibly draw out their hearts in love to him.

               <hi>thy coming is believing.</hi> Oh, for more acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with the Life of Faith: it is moſtly with us in ſpirituals, according to our Faith.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Hope;</hi> whereby we expect a future good. Hope is the daughter of Faith. Many a time the weak Mother leans upon the Daughter; Hope (at leaſt to our apprehenſions) hath not ſo many Obſtructions and hinderances as Faith. I dare ſay, <hi>I hope,</hi> what I dare not ſay, <hi>I believe.</hi> Though I muſt tell you, <hi>That which the over-modeſt Chriſtian calls a weak Hope, God often calls a ſtrong Faith. Remember</hi>

               <hi>the word unto thy ſervant, upon which thou haſt cauſed me</hi> to hope: There's a prayer of Hope, and here's a Promiſe-anſwer to Faith, <hi>Thou</hi>

               <hi>wilt keep him in perfect peace, whoſe mind is ſtayed on thee, becauſe he truſteth in thee,</hi> &amp;c. So that in a word, as to the preſent Caſe, though I yet cannot love God as I would, I hope God will help me, that my Love ſhall be alwayes growing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Patience</hi>
               <note n="(c)" place="margin">Jam. 1.4.</note> 
               <hi>Let patience have her perfect work, that you may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and intire, wanting nothing.</hi> And do but with Patience go on with your work, and no neceſſary Grace ſhall be wanting unto you. Look that you be patient in <hi>waiting,</hi> and patient in <hi>bearing.</hi> Do not miſinterpret God's deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with you. There are two paſſages I would have you take ſpecial notice of, that Ground that brought ſuch Fruit as anſwer'd expectation<note n="(d)" place="margin">Luk. 8.15.</note>, was <hi>an

Let's make an Eſſay, <hi>Thou would'ſt have God manifeſt his Love to thee in a more raviſhing manner;</hi> ſtay a while, thou wanteſt another kind of diſpenſation firſt, and moſt, <hi>viz.</hi> to feel more of the evil of ſin, that thou mayſt be more watchful and more holy. <hi>So ſoon as a tryal comes, thou wouldſt have it remov'd;</hi> ſtay a while, it hath not done the work for which God ſent it. God in kindneſs binds on the Plaiſter, till he hath effected the Cure. <hi>Thou art at a loſs, thou knoweſt not what God will doe with thee:</hi> be it ſo, it is not fit thou ſhouldeſt, God doth not uſe to tell his Children before-hand what he will do with them: God expects we ſhould gather up our Duty from the Precepts of his Word, and from the hints of his Providence. We read<note n="(e)" place="margin">2 King. 13.17, 18, 19.</note>, that when the Prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> had given King <hi>Joaſh</hi> a Promiſe, and a ſign of deliverance from <hi>Syria,</hi> God expected that his own <hi>reaſon</hi> and <hi>faith</hi> ſhould prompt him ſo to improve a ſecond ſign, as to purſue the victory to a conqueſt; but he underſtood it not, and ſo miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carryed. Do you learn to hold on in the uſe of all Means for the engaging of your hearts more to God. <hi>We</hi>

               <hi>deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence, to the full Aſsurance of Hope unto the end: that you be not ſloathful, but followers of them who through Faith and Patience inherit the Promiſes.</hi> Not expecting to obtain the Promiſe till you have patiently endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: and the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> in the ſame Epiſtle tells us<note n="(g)" place="margin">Heb. 10.36.</note>, that <hi>you have need of patience, that after you have done the will of God, you might receive the Promiſe.</hi> Thus much for the <hi>inward</hi> Means of loving God. <hi>Outward</hi> Means for engaging our Hearts to love God, are either <hi>Directing</hi> or <hi>Exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>Directing.</hi> The onely directing Means is the <hi>Word</hi> of God, but ſeeing you ſhall in the following <hi>Sermons</hi> have particular directions about both <hi>Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Reading</hi> of the Word, I ſhall only hint theſe few things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Prize the Word.</hi> Though our eſtimation of it will be exceedingly height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by a further acquaintance with it, yet you will find it ſingularly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious to the enflaming of your hearts, to get your hearts (as it were) graciouſly foreſtalled with the valuation of the Word. When we can count the Word ſweeter than Honey to the <hi>taſte;</hi> better than Gold for a <hi>treaſure;</hi> more neceſſary than Food for our <hi>ſuſtenance</hi>
               <note n="(i)" place="margin">Job 23.12.</note>: how can the Soul chooſe but love God, whoſe <hi>love</hi> indited it? Shall filthy books provoke carnal love, and ſhall not the Book of God provoke Divine love? endeavour to get but as ſpiritual a ſence and reliſh of Divine Truths, anſwerable to mens carnal guſts and feeling of other things: do but dwell upon Truths till they affect you. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly here obſerve this neceſſary Caution: <hi>Dwell not ſo upon difficulties as to hinder your further enquiry into things more eaſily underſtood, but wait in a courſe of dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and you will be able to maſter thoſe difficulties, which 'tis next to impoſſible ſuddainly to fathom.</hi> Do but ſteer an even courſe between a <hi>careleſs</hi> neglect, and an <hi>anxious</hi> perplexity, about what you read or hear, and you will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attain a <hi>deep</hi> knowledge of the things of God, and a <hi>high</hi> meaſure of love to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Set immediately upon the practice of thoſe things which you ſhall be convinced
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:95740:15"/> to be your Duty.</hi> Let not your Affections cool upon any duty preſſed upon you. Do ſomething like that of<note n="(k)" place="margin">Dan. 2.8, &amp;c.</note> 
               <hi>Nebuchadnezzar;</hi> God revealed to him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of moment; he had loſt the matter, and underſtood not the meaning; but was (as others thought) unreaſonably importunate to recover both, and that preſently, before the impreſſion wore off, and the heat went over. So my brethren, fix the Word by ſpeedy practice. Though the ſeed of the Word is long in growing to perfection, yet it preſently takes root in order to growth. Were I therefore now exhorting you to <hi>Repentance,</hi> and could bring you to no nearer a reſolution, than to repent <hi>to morrow,</hi> my Exhortation were loſt; So <hi>now,</hi> while I preſs you to love God, and demonſtrate from Scripture, that it is your Duty; offer you Scripture-helps that may be effectual; provoke you with Scripture encouragements that may be overcoming; if you <hi>now</hi> put off all this till a <hi>fitter</hi> time; 'tis a thouſand to one, you put it off for ever. <hi>Read this over again,</hi> and then think, why ſhould not I <hi>now</hi> believe this; and how can I ſay, I <hi>now</hi> believe it, if I do not <hi>now</hi> put it in practice? and how can I ſay I practiſe it, if I omit any one Direction?</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Exemplary</hi> Means. And here I ſhall give you as ſhort a touch as may be, of <hi>Men, Angels,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf. We are much drawn by Examples Examples they are not only <hi>Arguments</hi> but <hi>Wings.</hi> They give us a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration, that Precepts are practicable.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Men.</hi> Why ſhould not we love God as well as ever <hi>Abraham</hi> did? God gives the word<note n="(k)" place="margin">Gen. 22, 2.3.</note>, <hi>Abraham, take</hi> now <hi>thy Son, thy only Son Iſaac, whom thou loveſt, and offer him for a burnt-offering. And Abraham roſe up early in the morning,</hi> &amp;c. Had he not loved God, ſo far as the Creature can love God, <hi>infinitely,</hi> every word would have been as a dagger to his heart. <hi>q. d. Abraham]</hi> I gave thee that Name, from thy being a Father of many People, but now be thou the death of that ſeed which I intended to multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply (God ſeemed to change his Name to <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> named his Son <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> an Enlarger of the People, who enlarged them from twelve tribes to two.) <hi>Take now</hi>] no time to demur upon it. <hi>Thy Son</hi>] ſo many years prayed for, and waited for. <hi>Thine onely Son</hi>] all the reſt of thy children are not worth thy owning. <hi>Iſaac</hi>] the Son of thy Laughter, now the Son of thy Sorrow. <hi>Whom thou loveſt</hi>] more than ever Father loved a child, and that upon ſeveral juſtifiable accounts. <hi>And get thee into the land of Moriah</hi>] though no time to deliberate before thou reſolveſt, yet time enough for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance before thou executeſt thy reſolutions. <hi>And offer him there for a burnt-offering</hi>] 'tis not enough to give him up to be ſacrificed by another, but thou thy ſelf muſt be the Prieſt to kill thy lovely child, and then to burn him to aſhes. <hi>And Abraham roſe up early,</hi> &amp;c.] he quarrels not with God, What doth God mean to give me ſuch a command, as never to any one elſe in this world? He conſults not his Wife, <hi>Oh what will Sarah ſay?</hi> He ſticks not at what might expoſe Religion, <hi>What will the Heathen ſay?</hi> You may well ſuppoſe great ſtruglings between <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Grace,</hi> but God ſeemed to preſs upon him with this Queſtion; Whether doſt thou love me or thy child moſt? <hi>Abraham</hi> doth as it were anſwer, Nay Lord, if that be the queſtion, it ſhall ſoon be decided, how, and where thou pleaſeſt. Another inſtance we have in <hi>Moſes</hi>
               <note n="(k)" place="margin">Exod. 3.13. and 33.15.18.</note>, if you will compare two or three Scriptures;
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:95740:15"/> 
               <hi>Moſes</hi> at firſt he enquires of God, as we do of a ſtranger, what is his Name; upon Gods further diſcovery he begs more of his ſpecial preſence, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's granting of that, his Love grows bold, and he ſaid, <hi>I beſeech thee ſhew me thy Glory;</hi> upon his finding God propitious, he begs that God would remove the cloud, and ſhew him as much of his Glory as he was poſſibly able to bear the ſight of. Take one inſtance more, and that is of <hi>Paul,</hi> who thinking God might have more glory by ſaving of many than by ſaving of him, was willing to quit the <hi>happineſs</hi> of ſalvation (for not the leaſt Grace, much leſs grace in the height of it, could poſſibly chooſe a neceſſity of hating and blaſpheming God, which is the venom of Damnation, but) his Love to God is greater than his love to himſelf; and ſo he'l reckon himſelf happy without <hi>Glory,</hi> provided God may be more glorified. And thus I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced three Examples, of one before the Law, one under the Law, and one under the Goſpel. How will you receive it, if I ſhall venture to ſay, <hi>We have in ſome reſpect more cauſe to love God than any, than all theſe Perſons put together?</hi> What ſingular gleams of warm Love from God they had more than we, are in ſome reſpects exceeded by the noon-day light, and heat of Goſpel-love that we have more than they. What love-viſits God was pleaſed to give them, are excelled by Chriſts (as to them) extraordinary preſence among us. What was to them a Banquet, is to us our daily bread. God opens the windowes of heaven to us. God opens his very heart to us. We may read more of the Love of God to us in one day, than they could in their whole Life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Angels,</hi> that unweariedly behold the face of God<note n="(l)" place="margin">Mat. 18.10.</note>; they refuſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may evidence their love to God. 'Tis ordinarily the Devils work to be the Executioners of Gods wrath: it is ſaid<note n="(m)" place="margin">Pſal. 78.49.</note>, <hi>he caſt upon them the fierceneſs of his anger, wrath and indignation, and trouble, by ſending evil Angels among them;</hi> but the good Angels will not ſtick at it when God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it<note n="(n)" place="margin">2 King. 19.35.</note>. <hi>The Angel of the Lord went out, and ſmote in the Camp of the Aſſyrians</hi> 185000. But now we have more cauſe to love God than the Angels; God hath expreſſed greater Love to us in Chriſt than he hath to them. <hi>He took no hold of Angels,</hi> &amp;c.<note n="(o)" place="margin">Heb. 2.16.</note> not any one of them receiv'd ſo much as the pardon of any one ſin. God would not bear with them in ſo much as the leaſt tittle. So ſoon as they ceaſed to love God with a perfect love, God hated them with a perfect hatred. And for the bleſſed Angels<note n="(p)" place="margin">Heb. 1.14:</note>, <hi>are they not all miniſtring ſpirits, ſent forth to miniſter for them who ſhall be heirs of ſalvation?</hi> but none of the Saints are to miniſter to the Angels in any thing. How ſhould we love ſuch a Maſter? but I have a Pattern to commend to you above the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and oh that the mention of Chriſts Love to his Father might tranſport us; though Chriſt did nothing but<note n="(q)" place="margin">Joh. 8.29.</note> what pleaſed his Father, Chriſt ſuffered every thing that might pleaſe him<note n="( )" place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note>.

               <pb n="24" facs="tcp:95740:16"/> yet Chriſt pray'd<note n="(u)" place="margin">Joh 17.23.</note> that <hi>the world may know that thou haſt loved them, as thou haſt loved me.</hi> Should not we then pray, and ſtrive to love God, as near as it is poſſible, as Chriſt loved him? Chriſt had not one hard thought of Gods ſevere Juſtice, no, not when he endur'd what was equivalent to the eternal torments of the Damned; and ſhall our love ſhrink at Gods fatherly Chaſtiſements? Chriſts love to God did not abate, while God poured out his Wrath: and ſhall ours abate under Medicinal Providences? whatever our outward condition is in this World, 'tis better than Chriſt's.</p>
            <p>Thus I have endeavoured to acquaint you what Abilities are requiſite, and how to attain them, that you may love God, &amp;c.</p>

How to improve and augment all our poſſible abilities to love God, with all our Heart, Soul, Mind, and Strength; and for this I ſhall give you one general (yet ſingular) direction (though I muſt inform, direct, and preſs ſeveral things under it,) and that is, <hi>ſet your ſelves to love God.</hi> Set upon it as you are able; do for the engaging of your love to God, as you would do for engaging your hearts in love to a perſon commended to you for marriage.

Do ſomething like this in ſpirituals. I now ſolemnly beſpeak your higheſt love for God. Perhaps God and thy ſoul are yet ſtrangers: thou haſt not yet met with him in his ordinances, nor ſavingly heard of him by his ſpirit: <hi>Don't ſlight the overture, for from thy firſt entertainment of it, thou wilt be infinitely happy.</hi> Every thing of Religion is at firſt uncouth, the work of mortification is harſh, and the work of hol<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Degrees of love to God. Pſal 31.23.</note>1.

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:95740:16"/> is never ſeparated from the loving of God as our benefactour. It is mention'd in <hi>Moſes's</hi>
               <note n="(a)" place="margin">Heb. 11.26.</note> commendation of that <hi>he eſteemed the reproach of Chriſt greater riches than the treaſures of Egypt: for he had reſpect unto the recompence of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</hi> To love God for hopes of heaven is not a mercenary kind of love, it is not only lawful that we <hi>may,</hi> but it is our duty that we <hi>muſt,</hi> love God for the glory that is laid up for us. Where is the man that will own the name of Chriſtian, who dare charge <hi>Chriſt</hi> with any defect of love to God, while the Scripture ſaith expreſly<note n="(b)" place="margin">Heb. 12.2</note>, <hi>that for the joy ſet before him he endured the croſs, deſpiſing the ſhame, and is ſet down on the right hand of the throne of God.</hi> Is it not (no queſtion but it is) an infinite kindneſs of God to make promiſes? and is it not groſly abſurd to ſay it is a ſin to believe them? when our love ſhall be perfected in heaven, ſhall we then love God? and ſhall not we then love God, as well for our perfect freedom from ſin, for our perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of grace, for the ſociety of Saints and Angels, as for himſelf? If you queſtion this, ſurely you will ſtartle more at what I ſhall farther aſſert, viz. <hi>To love God for temporal benefits, does infallibly evidence us eminently ſpiritual,</hi> nay further yet, I ſhall commend to the conſideration of the moſt conſiderate Chriſtian, <hi>Whether our loving of God for the good things of this life, doth not evidence a greater meaſure of love to God, than to love God onely for the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous communication of himſelf unto the ſoul?</hi> (I ſpeak of <hi>truely</hi> loving God, not of bare <hi>ſaying</hi> you love him) now I evidence it thus. God's gracious com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications of himſelf naturally tend to the engaging of the ſoul to love him, <hi>but the things of the world do not ſo.</hi> God's gracious communications of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſpeak <hi>ſpecial</hi> love on God's part, and that draws out love again: but a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>las, <hi>common mercies ſpeak no ſuch thing.</hi> Now then, that ſoul that is ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly ingenuous, as to love God for thoſe lower kinds of mercies, that do not of themſelves ſpeak any love from God to us, that love of God looks ſomething like (though it is infinitely ſhort of it, for it is impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent God in his loving of us, but it looks ſomewhat like) our being before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with God in the way of <hi>Special</hi> love. To love God <hi>ſpiritually</hi> for <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral mercies,</hi> how excellent is this love, though to love a <hi>Benefactor</hi> may be but the love of a <hi>brute,</hi> yet to love God <hi>Thus,</hi> as our Benefactor, cannot but be the love of a <hi>Saint,</hi> you ſee therefore that though you begin your love to God at <hi>below</hi> what is <hi>rational,</hi> it may inſenſibly grow up to what is little leſs than <hi>Angelical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſtep of our love to God, is <hi>to love God for himſelf,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is the moſt excellent good; you may abſtract the conſideration of his beneficence to us from his excellency in himſelf, and then when the Soul can riſe thus, <hi>Lord though I ſhould never have a ſmile from thee while I live, and ſhould be caſt off by thee when I dye, yet I love thee.</hi> Alas! why is this named as the ſecond ſtep, ſurely there are but few can riſe ſo high?

I will delight in the Almighty, or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; I will alwayes call upon God, though he ſhould never regard me. Or though the Soul under trouble will not own ſo much goodneſs in it ſelf, as to ſay thus, yet the converſation of ſuch Chriſtians ſpeaks it plainly, and can <hi>ſuch</hi> a frame proceed from any thing but love to God? doth not grace work in the Soul like Phyſick in the Body? the Mother gives her Child Phyſick, the Phyſick (in its working) makes the Child Sick, the Child when ſick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of being angry with the Mother for the Phyſick, makes all its moan to the Mother, hangs about her, layes its head in her boſome: Is not this love to the Mother, though ſhe gave this Sick-phyſick? So my Brethren, God deals with his Children; what though ſome of his dealings makes them heart-ſick, yet they cling to him, fearing nothing but Sin, and can bear any thing but his diſpleaſure.

(though by the way thoſe betray their weakneſs who thus complain, for did they but obſerve their want of evidence of divine love, and did they more ſympathize with the Church of Chriſt under the Croſs, they would find they need not complain for want of afflictions) But be it ſo, complain they do, and that for want of afflictions; Afflictions are no way lovely, we are no where bid to pray for them; but 'tis our duty to pray for preventing and removing them, and yet the gracious Soul is through love to God, (in ſome reſpect) in love with them: Here's a notable degree of divine love, that the Soul would upon any terms experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the love of God; and engage the heart in love to God again, and to love nothing but for God.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth ſtep of our love to God is, <hi>for our higheſt love of every thing to be hatred in compariſon of our love to God.</hi> The truth is, we can never ſo plainly know to what a degree we love God, as by weighing it againſt what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſtands in competition with it. Why ſhould I ſo far debaſe my love to God as to weigh it in the ſame ballance with love to ſin? but alas! why do beſotted Sinners ſo dote upon ſin, as if love to God were not worthy to be compar'd with it? Methinks I may a little more than allude to that paſſage of <hi>Iſaiah</hi>
               <note n="(h)" place="margin">Iſa. 46.6.</note>, <hi>they laviſh Gold out of the bag, and weigh Silver in the ballance, and hire a Goldſmith, and he maketh it a God,</hi> &amp;c. they give out their Gold by handfuls, without weighing, for matter of their Idols, but they will be good Husbands in their expences about the workmanſhip of them. Man cares not at what rate he loves his Idols, thoſe luſts upon which they beſtow their affections due to God alone; though in all other things they are wary enough. But why ſhould I waſt time in ſpeaking to <hi>theſe?</hi> they have not yet gone one ſtep towards the love of God; and therefore are ſo far behind, that they are not within learning of what is ſpoken to good proficients in
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:95740:18"/> the love of God. Let me only leave with them this parting word, <hi>From a perſon's firſt ſincere and ardent love to God, he can neither ſpeak, nor think of ſin without abhorrency.</hi> From the firſt infuſion of grace, there's a graciouſly natural antipathy againſt ſin. Sin receives its death's wound, 'tis too true, it may ſtruggle for life, and ſeem to be upon recovery, but grace will <hi>wear</hi> it out, and will never leave the conflict till it has obtain'd the conqueſt. But this is not the thing I intended to ſpeak to in this particular; it is other-gueſs things than Sin, that the Soul that loves God is afraid to ſpill his love upon: he prizeth thoſe Ordinances wherein he meets with Communion with God, but is afraid his love ſhould terminate there: he values them but as Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows to let in the light: though ſomething excellent may be written there, as with the point of a Diamond, yet it is neither writing, nor window is prized, but the light; when that's gone, ſhut up the window as if it were a dead wall, that's no more regarded till the light returns. 'Tis the <hi>light of God's countenance that is better than life it ſelf.</hi> Perhaps you'l ſay this comes not up to what I aſſerted; that our higheſt love to every thing, is to be hatred in compariſon of our love to God. Well, let this be warily conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered: one whoſe love to God is at this height, is exactly curious in the management of his graces, and while he is ſo, he is as curiouſly jealous, leſt grace ſhould warp to rob God of his glory. He loves inherent grace heartily, Oh (ſaith he) that my Soul were more enrich'd with it; but yet while he is breathing after perfection in grace, he admiringly prefers God's wiſe love in ſaving him by Chriſt, before Salvation by inherent grace; he utterly renounceth the beſt of his graces, when pride would have them juſtle with Chriſt for the procuring of acceptation. In ſhort, a Soul that is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with God's method of Salvation, is unable to bear any thing that dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens it. Would God have me to be as watchful againſt ſin, as if there were no Chriſt to pardon it?<note n="(i)" place="margin">1 Joh. 2.1.</note> 
               <hi>My little Children theſe things I write unto you, that you ſin not.</hi> Our firſt care muſt be not to ſin.

Would God have me to reſt as entirely upon Chriſt after my utmoſt attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as that wretch who pretends to venture his Soul with him out or an ill-ſpent life? O Lord! I truſt no more to my good works, than he can to his bad ones for his meriting of Salvation<note n="k" place="margin">
                  <hi>Let not this be miſtaken, as if I made no difference between good works and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil. The Apoſtle hath taught me better,</hi> Tit. <hi>3.8.</hi> This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will, that thou affirm constantly, that they that have believed in God might be careful to maintain good works: Theſe things are good and profitable unto men, <hi>and</hi> ver. <hi>14.</hi> Let us alſo learn to maintain good works, for neceſſary uſes, that they be not unfruitful. <hi>Good works they are genuine fruits, though not meritorious cauſes of Juſtification.</hi>
               </note>; as I would not ungratefully overlook any thing the Spirit hath done in me, ſo I would not have any thing which I have almoſt marr'd in the Spirits do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it, to draw a curtain whereby Chriſt ſhould be leſs look'd on.</p>

The moſt eminent degree of our love to God, is <hi>Extaſie and Raviſhment;</hi> we need not go down to the Legends of the Philiſtines to ſharpen our incentives to the love of God.

<pb n="29" facs="tcp:95740:18"/> compare but theſe three paſſages in the Song of Songs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2 5. <hi>I am ſick of love;</hi> This is upon Chriſt's firſt overcoming diſcovery of himſelf. <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.8. <hi>I charge you O daughters of Jeruſalem, if you find my beloved, that you tell him that I am ſick of love.</hi> This charge is from her ſpiritual languiſhment, through earneſt deſire of reconciliation, after ſome negligence and careleſsneſs in duty. <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6. This is when ſhe hath had the higheſt communion with God, that an imperfect ſtate affords, when ſhe was as it were, upon the threſhold of glory; and then ſhe ſaith, <hi>love is ſtrong as death,</hi> q.d. I <hi>ſhall</hi> dye unleſs thou grant my deſire, or <hi>let</hi> me dye that my deſire may be granted; <hi>Jealouſie is cruel as the grave;</hi> that as the grave is never ſatisfyed, ſo neither will my love without the utmoſt enjoyments of thy ſelf: <hi>The coals thereof are coals of fire, which have a moſt vehement heat;</hi> my love burns up my cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, ſhines in holineſs, and mounts upwards in heavenly-mindedneſs; <hi>many waters cannot quench it:</hi> the waters of afflictions are but as Oyl to the fire. <hi>If a man would give all the ſubſtance of his houſe for love, it would utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be contemned.</hi> She ſcorns all things that would force, or flatter her, out of her love to Chriſt. Now if you except againſt this as ſpoken of love to Chriſt, and not of love to God <hi>eſſentially,</hi> to God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. I readily anſwer, we cannot ſee God lovely but in Chriſt. If any will be ſo curious as to aſſert they look upon Chriſt himſelf as but a means to bring them to God, it is God Eſſentially, Father, Son, and Holy-Ghoſt, when Chriſt ſhall have given up his Mediatory Kingdom<note n="(l)" place="margin">1 Cor. 15.28.</note>, that muſt be their compleat happineſs; the means is not to be reſted in, in compariſon of the end<note n="(m)" place="margin">Rev. 5.2, 3.</note>.

               <q>O Lord my God, thou art the Good of every good, Good above all good things, a Good moſt infinitely infinite; How therefore ſhould I love thee? How ſhall I proportionably love thee infinitely? O that I could! But how can I that am ſo very little and finite, love thee infinitely? and how otherwiſe will there be any proportion between thy lovelineſs and my loves? my God thou art ſuper-amiable, thou infinitely exceedeſt all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things that are lovely. Perhaps Lord, I ſhould love thee infinitely as
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:95740:19"/> to the Manner, when I cannot as to the Act. It pertains to the manner of loving, to love thee finally for thy ſelf; and no other good finally for it ſelf, but for thee, who art the chiefeſt good, and the beginning and end of all good things. But perhaps I may in ſome ſort, love thee infinitely, as to the Act both intenſively, and extenſively: intenſively, in loving thee more intenſly, more firmly, more ſtrongly than any finite good, and when I love nothing but for thy ſake: extenſively, when I compare thee Lord, with all other great and good things, and had rather they, and my ſelf alſo had no being, than once to offend my good God. But yet moſt loving Lord when I conſider a proportion of love, I am greatly troubled. If love ſhould be according to the worth of the Object; by how much thou art better than I am, and more profitable to me, than I am to my ſelf; I ſhould love thee more than thou loveſt me: but that I never can. O Lord I beſeech thee, how much doſt thou love me? is it weakly, and remiſly according to my goodneſs? that be far from thee Lord. Thou loveſt thine incomparably more, than thou art loved of them; as thou art incomparably greater, and better than they. But O great, and good God, that filleſt heaven and earth, yea the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee. Why doſt thou not fill my poor little ſoul? O my ſoul, why doſt thou not open all thy little doors? why doeſt not thou extend thy utmoſt capacity, that thou may'ſt be wholy poſſeſt, wholy ſatiated, wholy de-ebriated with the ſweetneſs of ſo great love; eſpecially when though thou art ſo little, yet thou canſt not be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with the love of any leſſer good. Many queſtions might be propoſed to expoſtulate my ſoul into a flame of love. But I ſee Lord, 'tis eaſie to ſpeak and write theſe things, but 'tis hard to doe, and perfect them in effect. Thou therefore moſt good and Almighty Lord to whom nothing is difficult, grant I pray thee, that I may more eaſily doe theſe things with my heart, than profeſs them with my mouth, &amp;c.</q>

            <p>And thus having after my poor manner put you upon practice, and point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you the way from the loweſt to the higheſt ſtep of divine love, I am ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that both good and bad have their exceptions ready againſt what I have delivered. The humble <hi>trembling</hi> Chriſtian, he fears that if the loweſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of love to God, hath ſuch heights in it, he ſhall never be able to reach it; and he is grieved whom God would not have made ſad.

If I could therefore propoſe any thing that would <hi>apply it ſelf, i. e.</hi> by its own evidence work it ſelf into the conſcience, I might hope to diſſolve their ſelf-flatteries, I cannot at preſent think of a more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendious way of undeceiving both theſe, and of further perſwaſively urging the love of God, than by plainly naming the <hi>infallible</hi> Properties, and <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant</hi> Effects of this love hereby thoſe that deſpondingly fear they want it, will find they have it; and thoſe that groundleſly boaſt of it, will find they want it, and both be inſtructed what muſt be done to evidence and exert it.</p>

            <p>And whereas thou complaineſt that thou feareſt thy Love is not ſincere, becauſe 'tis ſelfiſh; be not diſcouraged, while thou ſtudyeſt to pleaſe God, feareſt to offend him, prizeſt his preſence, mourneſt for his abſence; thy love to God is <hi>infallibly</hi> ſincere, though there be an ingredient of ſelf in it: nay, let me ſay more, it could not be ſincere, if thou didſt not mind thy ſelf: as in the very quinteſſence of Conjugal Love, 'tis impoſſible to abſtract it from ſelf-love; ſo the more we love God, the more we cannot but love our ſelves, yea even then when we moſt deny our ſelves out of love to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Divine Love <hi>is far from perfection,</hi> 'tis ſubject to more ſenſible languiſhments and infirmities than any other grace; though it can never be totally and finally extinguiſht.

I ſhall neither name more, nor enlarge further on this firſt rank of Characters, but be brief alſo in the ſecond.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Abſolute</hi> Properties of Love to God are among many, ſome of them ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the moſt <hi>ingenious</hi> of all Graces. In poor inconſiderable Loves, not worth the mentioning, how do perſons contrive wayes for the expreſſing and exciting of Love; and there's no way to prevent it: Oh how much
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:95740:20"/> more, when the Soul loves God? there's nothing <hi>meliorates</hi> the parts like Grace; Divine Love makes the beſt improvement of Wit, Parts, Time; when a Perſon loves to pray, though he can ſcarce ſpeak <hi>ſence</hi> to men, he can <hi>ſtrenuouſly</hi> plead with God; a perſon that loves to <hi>meditate,</hi> though he knows not how to make his thoughts hang together in other things, they multiply on his hand with a ſpiritual and profitable conſiſtency. In ſhort, to do any thing that may engage the Heart to God, what gracious ſtratagems doth Love abound with? That<note n="(m)" place="margin">
                  <hi>Nierem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg. de art.</hi> Vol. p. 114.</note> as he that beholds his Face in a Glaſs, makes the Face which he ſees; <hi>his very look is the Penſil, the Colour, the Art;</hi> ſo he that loves God, ſees ſuch a Reflexion of God's love to him, that a proud perſon doth not more pleaſe her ſelf in her own fancyed beauty, than this gracious Soul is graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly delighted in the mutual dartings of Divine Love. Keep from Will-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and humane Inventions in the things of God, eſpecially from impoſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on others your Prudentials of Devotion: and then I will commend it to you, to try all the Experiments which the Scripture will warrant, to encreaſe the flame of your Divine love.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Love to God is the moſt <hi>bold, ſtrong, conſtant,</hi> and <hi>daring</hi> Grace, of all the Graces of the Spirit of God<note n="(n)" place="margin">Cant. 8.6.</note>. <hi>Love is ſtrong as Death:</hi> every one knows what work Death makes in the World. It is not the <hi>Power</hi> of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates, nor the <hi>Reverence</hi> of Age, nor the <hi>uſefulneſs</hi> of Grace, can prevent its ſtroke, it conquers all. <hi>So doth love to God.</hi> Nothing can ſtand before it: what dare not love to God attempt? It deſigns impoſſibilities, <hi>viz.</hi> Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and is reſtleſs for the want of it. I may in ſome ſence ſay, it would fain have contradictions true, <hi>viz.</hi> to be without the Body, while in it; (the Body's being a clog is ſo weariſome.) Love to God not only baffles Satan, but through God's gracious condeſcenſion, it even prevails with God himſelf, that God will deny nothing to the Soul that loves him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Love to God is the onely <hi>ſelf-emptying, and ſatisfying Grace</hi>

               </gap> immediately from the Father of Spirits; by Regeneration we return to God again, from whom by Sin we are eſtranged; and by love we live in him in ſome little reſemblance to the Child's living in the Mother's womb: what the mother loves, the child loves; what the mother longs for, the child longs for; in the mothers health, the child is well; the child lives there in a far different manner, from how it lives in the world; though it can't ſtir out of its en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure, yet it never cries nor complains of it's Impriſonment: So the Soul that entirely loves God, hates what God hates, and loves what God loves; its life is far above the life of others, and it deſires no greater liberty than
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:95740:21"/> to be (as it were) impriſon'd in God; to have no will of its own, no one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion but what God graciouſly concurs in; yet 'tis ſo far from eſteeming this a reſtraint, that it counts it the higheſt happineſs of its imperfect ſtate; he feels a ſweetneſs in that, beyond what the Heathen that ſpake it, ever thought of, <hi>in God we live, move, and have our being.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The love of God makes us <hi>anxiouſly weary of Life it ſelf:</hi> in this love there's <hi>one</hi> Death and <hi>two</hi> Reſurrections<note n="(r)" place="margin">Gal. 2.20.</note>. <hi>I am crucified with Chriſt, nevertheleſs I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me.</hi> Chriſt lives, and the Soul lives, and both by Love. I muſt acknowledge, all manner of love is apt to be extravagant and irregular; our very love to God is in this blind, when it comes to any conſiderable height; 'tis apt to overlook (not in a way of Neglect, but Extaſie) what is to be done and ſuffer'd, and would fain be at the enjoyment of God in Heaven. By the way, let not doubting Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans be diſcourag'd, becauſe it is not thus with them. Though theſe Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties be but in the <hi>bud,</hi> they may in time be full <hi>blown;</hi> therefore believe and wait: heights of grace are ordinarily as well the work of <hi>time,</hi> as of the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God; Beſides, you know there's nothing more common than for Lovers to diſſemble their love; ſo here, 'tis too common for gracious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons rather to bely the Spirit of God, than thankfully to own their love to God: becauſe they are afraid of being miſtaken, and they are afraid of boaſting of a falſe Gift; and here, though Love when 'tis perfect, it caſteth out Fear, yet while it is imperfect Fear proveth our Love. Thus much of the Poſitive Properties, I'le be very brief in the <hi>tranſcendent</hi> properties of our love to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Love to God is <hi>the great General directing Grace,</hi> containing all other particular Graces in it, and moſt intimately goes through the Acts of all of them<note n="(s)" place="margin">
                  <hi>V<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>et. ibid.</hi> 1 Cor. 13.</note>. Love in the Soul is as the <hi>Pilot</hi> in the Ship, who ſteers the Ship and all its Paſſengers. Love ſteers the Soul and all its Operations. Love is the <hi>Needle</hi> in the Compaſs that's ſtill trembling towards its Divine Load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone. <hi>Euſeb. Nieremb.</hi> compares other Graces to Bullion <hi>uncoyn'd,</hi> which though it have an intrinſick value, yet
'tis not that Money that anſwers all things: what ſhall I ſay, find out a thouſand tranſcendent Metaphors, love will anſwer them all?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is in a <hi>ſingular manner infinite.</hi> Among all the Faculties of the Soul, there's none but the <hi>Will</hi> that can in any ſound ſence be ſaid to be infinite; all the other Faculties are more bounded than the <hi>Will;</hi> now love is the natural Act of the will, and love to God is the ſupernaturally natural Act of the renewed Will. Its <hi>deſires</hi> (which is the <hi>love of deſires</hi>) are to be united unto God, the Fountain of all Bleſſedneſs. And here, thoſe that love God leaſt, (ſo it be ſincerely) their deſires are infinite, <hi>e. g.</hi> Deſires are the <hi>feet</hi> of the Soul, their love will creep when it cannot goe; Deſires are the <hi>wings</hi> of the Soul, love will flutter when it cannot fly; Deſires are the <hi>breathings</hi> of the Soul, love will pant, and groan, and gaſp, where it can do no more. Again, the contentment and ſatisfaction of the Will (which is the <hi>love of complacency</hi>) is infinite (in as large a ſenſe as that word can be aſcribed to Creatures,) deſires are the <hi>motion</hi> and <hi>exerciſe</hi> of love; delight is the <hi>quiet</hi> and <hi>repoſe</hi> of it. My beloved, to have the heart to delight in God, or
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:95740:21"/> to ake and tingle with the diſcourſe of the love of God, through reflection up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the want of it, as unable to ſtand under his own thoughts, this infallibly ſhews great love; and this Soul's ſatisfaction in God is in ſome ſort infinite.</p>
            <p>Effects of love to God, they relate either to <hi>God</hi> himſelf, or to <hi>our ſelves,</hi> or they are <hi>mutual;</hi> I'le ſpeak briefly of each. <hi>Effects</hi> that relate to God,<note place="margin">Effects of love to God.</note> are ſuch as theſe; I do not only ſay theſe, but theſe, and ſuch as theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hatred of, and flight from all that is evil. Joſeph</hi> may be our inſtance, his miſtriſs would have inveigled him into ſin, but though<note n="(t)" place="margin">Gen. 39.10.</note> 
               <hi>ſhe ſpake to him day by day,</hi> yet he <hi>hearkned not unto her, to lye by her, or to be with her;</hi> he that fears ſin will get as far as he can out of the reach of a temptation. <hi>Hatred of ſin always holds proportion with our love to God:</hi> our <hi>inward</hi> hatred of ſin with our <hi>inward</hi> love of God; our <hi>return</hi> to ſin with the <hi>decay</hi> of our love to God. The <hi>renewing</hi> of our repentance anſwers the <hi>reviving</hi> of our love to God. <hi>Every one that doth not love God, loves ſin,</hi> plain down-right ſin, <hi>ſin without any excuſe,</hi> e.g. either ſome <hi>moral</hi> wickedneſs, or a <hi>reſting</hi> in their own righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The fear of God.</hi> A reverential tenderneſs of Conſcience, leſt we ſin againſt God. It is not onely fear of hell, but fear of God's goodneſs<note n="(u)" place="margin">Hoſ. 3 5.</note>, <hi>they ſhall fear the Lord and his goodneſs in the latter days.</hi> The ſoul that loves God, is troubled that he either does, or omits any thing for fear of hell, and that he is no more affected with love-arguments. Though, pray, take notice by the way, <hi>That all fear of hell doth not preſently argue a ſpirit of bondage;</hi> Hopes and Fears poyſe the Soul while in this World. I would therefore leave this charge upon you, <hi>viz.</hi> Be ſure that you love God better than the bleſſed <hi>Apoſtle</hi> lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him, before you cenſure any for want of love, who are diligent in duty upon this motive, <hi>leſt they be at laſt caſt-aways</hi>

But to return, Though Gods gracious condeſcention be ſo great as to allow thoſe that love him a non ſuch familiarity, yet that never breeds the leaſt contempt. Senſe of diſtance between God and the Soul, between the holy God, and a ſinful Soul, between the faithful God, and the fickle Soul: O this cauſeth holy tremblings, and humble Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies in our moſt familiar pleadings with God.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Obedience to the commands of God,</hi> and to thoſe commands which would never be obeyed but out of love to God<note n="(b)" place="margin">1 Joh. 5.3.</note>. <hi>For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments, and his commandments are not grievous, e. g.</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey

God doth not deal with us as with ſlaves, but takes us into that relation, which ſpeaks moſt delight and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and we are never more our own, than when we are moſt abſolutely his.</p>

'tis written to inſtruct us againſt cruelty; but may we not learn a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther leſſon, the bird was ſafe while on her neſt; our onely ſafety is with God. Now to cleave to God in all conditions, not onely when we fly to him as our onely refuge in our preſſures, but in our higheſt proſperity, and outward hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, when we have many things to take to, whence the world expects hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, this is a fruit of great and humble love, this demonſtrates an underva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luing of the world, and a voluntary chooſing of God; this is ſomewhat like heavenly love.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Tears and ſighes through deſires and joys;</hi> when the ſpiritual love-ſick ſoul, would in ſome ſuch, but an unexpreſſable manner, breath out it's ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows and joys into the boſom of God. Lord, why thus loving to me, and why is my heart no more overcome with divine love? thoſe that never receiv'd ſo much from thee, love thee more. O I am weary of my want of love! O I am weary of my diſtance from God!

            <p>The onely effect I ſhall name as to us, is, <hi>a ſeeking of heaven and things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, with contempt of the world, and all worldly excellencies.</hi> One that loves
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:95740:22"/> God thinks he can never do enough in heavenly employments. A perſon that abounds in love to God is too apt to neglect ſecondary duties, which are in their places neceſſary: they are apt to juſtle out one duty with another, <hi>e.g.</hi> thoſe duties wherein they have moſt ſenſible communion with God, bear down leſſer duties before them: whereas could we keep within Scripture-bounds, and mind every duty according to it's moment, then this is an excellent ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of divine love, <hi>e. g.</hi> to be afraid of worldly enjoyments, leſt they ſhould ſteal the heart from God; yet at the ſame time not to dare to omit any worldly du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, leſt I ſhould prove partial in the work of Chriſtianity. To make conſcience of the leaſt duties, becauſe no ſin is little, but to be proportionably careful of the greateſt duties, leſt I ſhould prove an hypocrite: ſuch a carriage is an excellent effect of divine love, this is fruit that none who are not planted near the tree of life can bear.</p>

               <note n="(p)" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicates <hi>the divine Nature</hi> to us through his fulfilling <hi>exceeding great and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes:</hi> We make returns as thoſe that are born of God in obeying his commands. Becauſe God loves us, he communicates unto us his commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicable properties, of holineſs, wiſdom, goodneſs. Seeing we have nothing to return, we proſtrate our ſelves at his feet, ingenuouſly acknowledge our unholineſs, folly, and badneſs. God and the Soul holds communication in all gracious actions: God communicates ſtrength to the doing of thoſe things which he cannot do<note n="(q)" place="margin">Through his perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</note>, but we muſt; to repent, believe, obey God; theſe are <hi>our</hi> actions through <hi>his</hi> ſtrength. Again, we exerciſe our graces upon God for thoſe his actions which we cannot do, but (we may through his covenant engagement, with humble thankfulneſs ſay) he muſt, <hi>e. g.</hi> for the pardon of ſin, ſpeaking peace to the Conſcience, giving out of gracious in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for theſe we admire God, we praiſe him, rejoyce in him. Once more, in thoſe things wherein we can make no return to God, but may to others for God's ſake; our love to God neceſſitates us to do it, <hi>e. g.</hi> God pities us, is merciful and kind to us; God is infinitely above all ſuch returns: Ay, but ſo are not the Members of Chriſt, who are the beſt viſible Image of God in the world: I'le give them not only my <hi>alms,</hi> but my very <hi>bowels,</hi> &amp;c. In ſhort, in this communication, God and the gracious Soul have the <hi>ſame</hi> intereſt, drive on the <hi>ſame</hi> deſign (the advancement of Chriſt and the Goſpel) have the <hi>ſame</hi> friends, and the <hi>ſame</hi> enemies. They communicate ſecrets to each other; none but the loving Soul knows the ſecrets of divine love, and none but God hears all the ſecrets of the Soul without a reſerve. Among the deareſt friends in the world, there's ſome reſerve: Some things we'll rather ſpeak to a ſtranger, than to our deareſt boſome-friend; we think them not fit to mention, or we are loath to trouble them; but there's none of this between God and the Soul: God tells us all that may benefit, not overcharge us: we tell God all the very worſt of our own hearts, which we are aſhamed to men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe that moſt love us. God deals with us according to our capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, our bottles would break ſhould God over-fill them; but we deal with God according to the utmoſt of our active graces: God is both compaſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate to pity and pardon what's no way acceptable, and even incredibly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcending to accept of what none but his infinite grace would accept.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Familiar love-viſits.</hi> When God makes ſad viſits to the diſquieting of Conſcience, and the breaking of our peace; yet even then the Soul, under trouble of Conſcience, would not change its ſpiritual trouble for the beſt of the worlds peace, no not for its former peace, with which 'twas ſo well pleas'd before converſion; the Soul that loves God cannot conſtrue that to be a viſit
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:95740:23"/> which others count ſo. The Soul never goes to God as we go to viſit thoſe we care not for, that we are glad at their being from home, ſo the viſit be but pay'd, we care not. Pray compare ſome paſſages in that Song of loves; one while you have the Spouſe enquiring of Chriſt<note n="(r)" place="margin">Cant. 1.7.</note>; <hi>Tell me (O thou whom my ſoul loveth) where thou feedeſt, where thou makeſt thy flocks to reſt at noon: for why ſhould I be as one that turneth aſide by the flocks of thy Companions,</hi> q. d. Tell me, O Lord, my love and life, where I may have both inſtruction, and protection in an hour of trouble; leſt through thy ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence I be ſeduced by thoſe that only pretend to love thee.

O my mourning dove, that dareſt not ſtir out of thy ſecret place, ſtir up thy faith, hold up thy face with comfort, let me hear thy prayers and praiſes; though others cenſure them, I eſteem them; though others count thee deformed, thou art in my eyes beautiful.

Chriſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently accepts the invitation<note n="(u)" place="margin">Cant. 5.1.</note>, <hi>I am come into my Garden, my Siſter, my Spouſe, I have gathered my Myrrh, with my Spices, I have eaten my Honey-comb with my honey; I have drunk up my Wine with my Milk: eat O friends, drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved.</hi> q. d. Thou ſhalt no ſooner ask, than be anſwer'd; I accept thy graces, and duties, thy bitter repentance, and thy fragrant holineſs, they are moſt ſweet to me, notwithſtanding their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; and ye, O my Friends, whether bleſſed Angels, or gracious Souls, do you chear your ſelves with the ſame ſpiritual dainties, wherewith I am refreſhed. This is much, but there is more in the next expreſſion I ſhall name<note n="(w)" place="margin">Cant. 6.5.</note>. <hi>Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me,</hi> q. d. I am raviſh'd and vanquiſh'd by thy fixed eye of faith; in ſhort, ſee the Spouſe's cloſing requeſt<note n="(y)" place="margin">Cant. 8.14.</note>: <hi>Make haſt my beloved, and be thou like to a Roe, or a young Hart upon the mountains of Spices;</hi> q. d. as I began this Song my deareſt Saviour, with paſſionate deſires of thy firſt coming by the Preaching of the Goſpel; ſo though I thankfully praiſe thee for all the communion I have had with thee, yet I cannot (my Lord) but more paſſionately long for thy glorious coming, to take me with thee from theſe bottoms of death, and valleys of tears, to thoſe eternal heights where nothing ſprings but life and glory; that inſtead of this Song I may ſing a new one to the Lamb, and to him that ſits upon the Throne unto all eternity. Thus (but in a far more Seraphick manner than I am able to expreſs) the Soul-loving God, as the God-loving Soul<note n="(z)" place="margin">Zeph. 3.17.</note> are <hi>rejoycing</hi> in each other with <hi>joy,</hi> till they <hi>reſt</hi> in each other's <hi>love.</hi> In ſhort, the Soul that loves God is never ſo well, as when moſt immediately with him, and while there's any diſtance, many a love-glance paſſeth between God and the Soul, even in the greateſt croud of buſineſs and diverſions.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>A putting a love-interpretation upon all things.</hi> God looks upon the very miſcarriages of thoſe whom he loves as their infirmities, and puts a

The Diſciples ſlept when Chriſt bade them watch, they wiſt not what to anſwer him: Chriſt himſelf excuſeth it better than they could, in ſaying, <hi>the ſpirit truly is ready, but the fleſh is weak.</hi> And the loving Soul is as loath to take any thing ill at the hands of God; when
'tis never <hi>ſo bad</hi> with the Soul, he bleſſeth God that it is <hi>no worſe.</hi> God and the loving Soul do thoſe things to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards each other, which nothing but love can put a good interpretation upon; the truth is, without love 'twere intollerable, <hi>e. g.</hi> God requires that Service of the gracious Soul, that he requires of no other; <hi>viz.</hi> to bleſs God when perſecuted, to rejoyce in tribulations, to hope againſt hope, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God puts the Soul that loves him, upon thoſe trials that he puts upon no other, <hi>viz.</hi> Thoſe chaſtiſements from himſelf, thoſe reproaches from men, thoſe buffetings from Satan, which are peculiar to Saints; but the Soul heartily loveth God under all theſe. Again, the Soul grows upon God in prayer, and the more it receives from God, the more inſatiable it is, and God loves the Soul the better for it. When afflictions are extream, thoſe that love God put the affliction upon the account of God's faithfulneſs: On the other hand, when the poor Soul is foil d, and Satan runs with the tidings of it to ſet God againſt him; God pities the Soul,<note place="margin">Zech. 3.1, 2. &amp;c.</note> and rates the Accuſer. <hi>And he ſhewed me Joſhua the High Prieſt ſtanding before the Angel of the Lord, and Satan ſtanding at his right hand to reſiſt him; and the Lord ſaid to Satan, the Lord rebuke thee, O Satan, even the Lord that hath choſen Jeruſalem rebuke thee,</hi> Joſhua <hi>was</hi> cloathed with filthy garments — <hi>take away the filthy garments from him,</hi> &amp;c. Here's <hi>Joſhua</hi> the High Prieſt, while executing his Office in offering Sacrifices and Prayers for the people, <hi>Satan</hi> arraigns him as a <hi>Priſoner</hi> at the Bar, and the accuſation being <hi>true</hi> and vehement, <hi>Satan</hi> takes the upper hand; but now, Jeſus Chriſt, as well the <hi>Patron</hi> as the <hi>Judge</hi> of Saints, cuts him ſhort with a vehement reproof, and tells him, thoſe ſins could not make void that choice, which they could not at firſt hinder; and farther Chriſt as it were tells him they had been ſeverely puniſhed, half burnt and waſted by the heat of Gods diſpleaſure; and would he now re-kindle that fire? No Satan, thy charge is, as it were, thrown out of the Court, his ſins ſhall be pardoned, his graces multiplyed, and upon the well-diſcharging of his office, he ſhall have <hi>places to walk among them that ſtand by;</hi> Alluding to the walks and galleries about the Temple, <hi>q. d.</hi> Thou ſhalt walk with theſe glorious Angels, they ſhall be thy Companions and Guardians, where Satan hath no place. So that Chriſt loves a Soul the more, not the leſs, for Satan's accuſations.</p>
            <p>To all theſe <hi>effects</hi> add theſe <hi>Concomitants,</hi> or thoſe things that have <hi>agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> with, or are near of <hi>kin</hi> to Divine Love; which do not really differ from it, only expreſs ſome part, or manner of it. In ſhort, 'tis love under ſome other <hi>form</hi> or notion. I ſhall only mention two Concomitants.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Devotion, which is an abſolute delivering up of our ſelves to Gods Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Service,</hi> ſo as by no flatteries or dangers to be diverted<note n="(e)" place="margin">1 Tim. 4.15.</note>. <hi>Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate upon theſe things, give thy ſelf wholly to them, that thy profiting may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to all.</hi> Herein lyes the ſtrength of Religion, and the ſpiritual pleaſure of it, herein the Soul can ſay with ſome kind of triumph<note n="(f)" place="margin">Iſa. 12.2, 3.</note>, <hi>Behold God is my Salvation; I will truſt and not be afraid; for the Lord Jehovah is my ſtrength,
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:95740:24"/> and Song, he alſo is become my Salvation. Therefore with joy ſhall ye draw water out of the wells of Salvation.</hi> Chriſtians, we muſt not only be <hi>barely</hi> frequent in religious actions; but we muſt act as thoſe that are <hi>given up</hi> to God, we muſt mind the <hi>fervour</hi> of Religion. We muſt be exceeding watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful over out <hi>thoughts</hi> to keep them from vanity, and over our <hi>affections</hi> to keep them from entanglement. I would therefore commend it to you, to <hi>ſingle out every morning ſome ſhort paſſages of Scripture, or ſome encouraging promiſe that hath affected you, to roll in your minds, or to lye upon your hearts all day to maintain this holy fervour;</hi> nothing works and keeps ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the heart as Scripture.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The other concomitant is <hi>Zeal, which is the moſt intenſe degree of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and endeavour to pleaſe, and honour God.</hi> 'Tis the boiling up of the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions to the greateſt heat; this muſt be the companion of every grace; now Zeal is expreſt <hi>againſt</hi> ſin, or <hi>in</hi> duty. In the exerciſe of Zeal againſt ſin, I beg of you to obſerve this <hi>Rule,</hi> viz. <hi>Whatever act of Zeal you expreſs to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards others, double it firſt upon your ſelves:</hi> whatever evil you <hi>reprove,</hi> or would <hi>reform</hi> in others, be <hi>doubly</hi> ſtrict againſt it in your ſelves. This is Chriſt's counſel, <hi>Caſt out the beam out of thine own eye, then ſhalt thou ſee clearly to pull out the mote out of thy Brother's eye;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 7.5.</note> Mine eye is not capable of having a beam in it, but a mote in mine own eye, ſhould be to me as a beam, in compariſon of what it is in anothers. Take a few Scripture inſtances (for this had need to be inculcated in the preſent age) in caſe of diſhonour done to God and your ſelves, compare <hi>Moſes</hi> his carriage<note n="(g)" place="margin">Numb. 12.2.</note>, <hi>Miriam</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> ſpake againſt <hi>Moſes, Hath the Lord indeed ſpoken only by Moſes? hath he not ſpoken alſo by us? and the Lord heard it,</hi> but <hi>Moſes</hi> was as if he heard it not, for he was <hi>very meek above all men that were upon the face of the earth:</hi> He was ſo indeed, but it was only in his own cauſe; when the glory of God is concerned, you'l find him of another temper. <hi>As ſoon as he ſaw the Calf, and the Dancing, Moſes's anger waxed hot — and he took the calf which they had made, and burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 32.19, 20, 22, 27.</note> 
               <hi>and ſtrewed it upon the water, and made the Children of Iſrael drink of it — And Moſes ſtood up in the gate of the Camp, and ſaid, who is on the Lord's ſ de, let him come unto me — and he ſaid, put every man his Sword by his ſide, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and ſlay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbour,</hi> &amp;c. Here is one <hi>ice-cold</hi> in his own cauſe, <hi>fire-hot</hi> in God's. Take another inſtance of <hi>Paul</hi>

            <p>For <hi>Zeal</hi> about <hi>duties</hi> I commend unto you this rule, <hi>In every duty you take in hand, endeavour to do it above your ſtrength,</hi> not only to the uttermoſt of your ſtrength, but above it.

You ſhall ſee (ſaith he) a <hi>Mother</hi> ſo buſie about her <hi>child,</hi> as if ſhe had no love for any one elſe, as if her Eyes were for nothing elſe but to <hi>look</hi> upon it, and her Mouth for nothing elſe but to <hi>kiſs</hi> it: But now if ſhe muſt loſe her <hi>child</hi> or her <hi>husband,</hi> her love to her Husband is ſo great, as if ſhe had no love for her child at all. So when God and thoſe we moſt dearly love, ſtand in <hi>competition;</hi> you may ſoon ſee the ſubordination of our love. Though let me add this for your encouragement, <hi>God never calls for the hating of other things for love to himſelf, but he doth moſt ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly make up in himſelf whatever any one parts with for him;</hi> when God requires the baniſhment of other Objects, it is to communicate himſelf more <hi>fully,</hi> more <hi>clearly,</hi> more <hi>ſweetly.</hi> Look over what <hi>Martyrology</hi> you pleaſe, I think you will ſcarce find ſo much as <hi>One,</hi> dying for Chriſt any other way than <hi>Triumphing;</hi> whereas many of as eminent Graces as they, dye in their Beds, little leſs than <hi>deſpairing.</hi> What encouragement may this be for the worſt of times?</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Our love to God doth more ſenſibly quiet our hearts, than God's love to us;</hi> for though God's love <hi>to us</hi> be infinitely greater than our love to God, yet till his love to us have drawn out our <hi>love to him,</hi> we do more abuſe his kindneſs than other perſons do whom he doth not ſo love. This is moſt evident in a perſon juſt upon the borders of converſion, but yet unconverted; God is abundant in his love of <hi>Benevolence,</hi> he is now engag'd upon the making of means effectual for his <hi>through-regeneration;</hi> but now in this work there are ſeveral things to be done, which though they ſpeak greater love on Gods part, than ever he before ſhewed him; yet while God is at work, the perſon <hi>quarrels</hi> with God <hi>more</hi> than about any <hi>former</hi> providences of his Life. God to tame him, brings him under great Afflictions, upon which he either <hi>flyes</hi> in his face, or lies <hi>ſullen</hi> at his feet, and thinks he may well do ſo; well, but God will not thus leave him, God follows him with terrors of Conſcience, <hi>the arrows of God ſtick faſt in him, and the poyſon thereof drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth up his ſpirits,</hi> but he will not yet yield, he holds faſt his iniquity, which he's as loth to part with as his life, and rather <hi>hates</hi> than <hi>loves</hi> God for all this kindneſs: ſo that till he is brought to love God, God's love to him doth no way quiet him; by which you may plainly ſee, that <hi>let Gods love to us be never ſo great, we miſinterpret all, till we love God again,</hi> and then let God do what he will,<note place="margin">Da mihi Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne Sanctum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morem tuum, &amp; mitte me ſi vis in ignem inferni, <hi>Stell. de amore dei, p. 314, &amp;c.</hi>
               </note> he is quiet, let his ſufferings be next to Hell torments, he'l not <hi>allow</hi> one hard thought of God. Therefore be perſwaded to <hi>get, encreaſe,</hi> and <hi>exerciſe</hi> this Love to God with all your <hi>hearts, ſouls</hi> and <hi>minds.</hi> I have been too long already, and therefore will be as brief as may be in anſwering theſe two Complaints.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Complaint.</hi> All that hath been ſaid, makes me fear I have no <hi>true</hi> love to God at all; I cannot ſay I love God <hi>more</hi> than the Creature, I feel my heart more ſenſibly <hi>warping</hi> towards the World in the Service of God, than <hi>ſpringing</hi> towards God in my worldly affairs.</p>
            <p>To this I anſwer by theſe Diſtinctions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Diſtinction</hi> 1. We muſt diſtinguiſh between the <hi>Eſtimation</hi> of our love, and the <hi>Commotion</hi> of it; the <hi>Commotion</hi> may be greater, where the <hi>Eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> is leſs: One whoſe love is fixed upon God, though he is ſo far from <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking</hi>
               <pb n="45" facs="tcp:95740:26"/> God, that he will forſake <hi>all things for God,</hi> yet he may till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect himſelf, be more moved with ſome petty loſs. In ſhort, he may have ſome violent <hi>Guſt</hi> of Affection after other things, but the <hi>conſtant</hi> breathings of his Soul is after God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We muſt <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between the <hi>ſolidity</hi> of our Love, and the <hi>flaſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of it, between a <hi>ſuperficial,</hi> and a <hi>laſting</hi> Joy; <hi>e. g.</hi> A Covetous man may <hi>laugh</hi> more when he is <hi>tickled,</hi> than when you give him a <hi>thouſand</hi> pound, but he is a <hi>thouſand</hi> times more <hi>joyful</hi> of his <hi>thouſand</hi> pound than of his being <hi>tickled.</hi> The Souls love to God is Well <hi>rooted</hi>
               <note n="(b)" place="margin">Eph. 3.18</note>. As a ſick man is pleaſed with one that will <hi>ſit</hi> with him, and <hi>alleviate</hi> his pains by <hi>diverſion;</hi> but he is more pleaſed with that man that ſhall <hi>cure</hi> him. While our Souls are in a <hi>ſickly</hi> frame, we are pleaſed a little with <hi>variety</hi> of Diverſions, but we ſoon ſee their <hi>emptineſs,</hi> and charge our Souls to return unto God for a <hi>perfect</hi> cure.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt <hi>diſtinguiſh</hi> between our <hi>ſpiritual</hi> love and our <hi>ſenſible</hi> love: while we live in this world, ſuch is our weakneſs through the <hi>remainders</hi> of Sin, and <hi>imperfection</hi> of Grace, that our <hi>Animal</hi> and <hi>Vital</hi> ſpirits are more affected with <hi>ſenſible</hi> things, than with <hi>ſpiritual.</hi> The things of the World are neer to us, and we cannot live without them; but yet he that loves God, never ſayes upon the Enjoyment of them<note n="(c)" place="margin">Luk. 12.i9.</note>, <hi>Soul take thine eaſe;</hi> Oh no, he is <hi>angry,</hi> and <hi>grieved</hi> that he is <hi>at all</hi> pleaſed about ſuch things.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Complaint.</hi> I hope I am not wholly deſtitute of this excellent Grace, yet I am afraid to own that I have it. Is it impoſſible to get my Heart above this uncomfortable uncertainty? O that my heart were more raiſed and fixed above this anxious temper!</p>
            <p>I'le cloſe all with an <hi>Eſſay</hi> to anſwer this Complaint; onely premiſe, Let not any thing that ſhall or can be ſpoken, be wreſted to give the <hi>leaſt</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement imaginable to any thing of <hi>Sin;</hi> take heed you do not upon any account gratifie your <hi>ſloth,</hi> or <hi>indifferency</hi> of ſpirit, or any ſins of <hi>Omiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on;</hi> keep off this Rock, and then <hi>thy ſolicitude about thy fickleneſs, gives thee grounds of hope to get above it.</hi> Take therefore theſe ſhort Directions, how to <hi>get</hi> and <hi>keep</hi> the moſt <hi>certain, conſtant, comfortable, ſpiritual</hi> frame of Divine love that is to be had upon Earth.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Keep a ſevere Watch againſt all ſins:</hi> yet give not way to drooping Fears, becauſe of <hi>unavoidable</hi> infirmities<note n="(d)" place="margin">Pſal. 130, 3, 4.</note>. <hi>If thou Lord ſhouldeſt mark i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niquities, O Lord, who ſhall ſtand? But there is forgiveneſs with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Obſerve your own temper,</hi> what it is that moſt draws out your love to any perſon or thing in this world, and improve that very inducement to love God<note n="(e)" place="margin">Cant. 5.16.</note>. <hi>He is altogether lovely;</hi> that is, <hi>Imagine or name any thing that is moſt deſirable, moſt worthy to be loved and admired,</hi> and <hi>that's he.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Endeavour</hi> to love God out of <hi>Duty,</hi> when (to your own apprehenſion) you cannot love him out of <hi>Grace:</hi> I would commend this to you for all <hi>your</hi> gracious <hi>carriage</hi> towards God, and for all the <hi>kindneſs</hi> you would <hi>receive</hi> from God; <hi>e. g. Repent</hi> as 'tis a <hi>duty,</hi> even while you fear you want the <hi>Grace</hi> of Repentance. <hi>Believe</hi> as 'tis a <hi>duty,</hi> while you think you
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:95740:27"/> cannot <hi>act</hi> Faith as a <hi>Grace.</hi> So <hi>juſtifie</hi> God (i. e. acknowledge God to be Righteous, though he condemn you,) when you fear God will <hi>not</hi> juſtifie you. <hi>Sanctifie</hi> God, (<hi>i. e.</hi> celebrate God's Holineſs) when you fear he'l <hi>not</hi> ſanctifie you, <hi>i. e. not make you holy.</hi> So <hi>ſet your ſelves</hi> to love God, <hi>i. e.</hi> take heed you do <hi>not</hi> offend him, do <hi>all</hi> you can to pleaſe him, take up with <hi>nothing</hi> on this ſide himſelf. In ſhort, <hi>Let God find you in a way of Duty, and you'l find God in a way of Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Study <hi>Chriſt.</hi> What Divine love we either <hi>receive</hi> or <hi>return,</hi> 'tis <hi>through</hi> Chriſt. <hi>You may look for encouragement from Chriſt for every thing but Sin.</hi> In every thing have recourſe to Chriſt<note n="(f)" place="margin">Col. 2.10.</note>, for the <hi>performance</hi> of every Duty, for the <hi>attaining</hi> of every Grace; when you fear Grace is <hi>withering,</hi> Chriſt will <hi>revive</hi> it<note n="(g)" place="margin">Cant. 3.10.</note>.

            <p>Beſides, how can we think that God would require us to bring back a ſtraying Ox, and to relieve an Aſſe oppreſſed with his burden, and lay no du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty on us to a Man in ſuch a condition? doubtleſs if we are bound to bring back an Ox that goeth aſtray, we are much more obliged to bring back a Man, when we find him going aſtray from God: and if we are to help an Aſſe, that lyeth under his burden, much more a Man, when we ſee him oppreſſed with His.</p>
            <p>We ſee then whom we are to account our Neighbour, any man whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever; Friend, or Enemy; that lives nigh to us, or at a greater diſtance from us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We come now to ſpeak of the ſecond thing propounded, and that is, the lawfulneſs of a mans loving himſelf. Every man may; yea, it is a <hi>Duty</hi> lying on every man to love himſelf.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:95740:29"/>
            <p>This may ſeem ſtrange, when we ſee ſelf-love every where branded in the Scripture; ſo that there is hardly any ſin deſcribed in ſo black a character as this. It is a ſin indeed, that includes many others in the bowels of it; we may ſay of it,<note place="margin">James 3.6.8.</note> as the Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> doth of the tongue, <hi>It is a fire, a world of iniquity, it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poiſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Unbelief and ſelf-love are the immediate parents of all the miſchiefs and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominations that are in the world; and therefore we have this ſet in the front of all the evils that make the laſt times perillous:<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.1.2.3.</note> 
               <hi>In the laſt days perillous times ſhall come, for men ſhall be lovers of their own ſelves, covetous, boaſters, proud, blaſphemers, diſobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural affection, truce-breakers, falſe-accuſers, incontinent, fierce, deſpiſers of thoſe that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleaſures, more than lovers of God,</hi> &amp;c. And if you can find a larger catalogue of abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations than you have here ſet down to your hand, ſelf-love is the mother of them all: it is <hi>this,</hi> that makes all the ſtir that is in the world: It is <hi>this,</hi> that diſturbs Families, Churches, Cities, Kingdoms: in a word, <hi>this</hi> is the grand Idol, that is ſet up to be worſhipped all the world over, greater by far than <hi>Diana</hi> of the <hi>Epheſians,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 19.27.</note> whom yet all <hi>Aſia</hi> and the world were ſaid to worſhip. It is that Idol, which every man muſt endeavour to take down, for until that be done, we ſhall find little peace within our ſelves, or quietneſs among men.</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this; we muſt ſay, that it is <hi>lawful,</hi> and a <hi>duty</hi> incumbent on every man to love himſelf.</p>
            <p>There is a two-fold ſelf, <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>A natural Self.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>A ſinful Self.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>This is to be hated, the other loved. We cannot hate ſinful ſelf too much though it be to the deſtruction of it; this is that which we are bound to kill, mortifie, and utterly deſtroy: Chriſt came into the world, purpoſely to help and aſſiſt us in the deſtruction of it;<note place="margin">1 John 3.8.</note> 
               <hi>For this purpoſe the Son of God was manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the devil.</hi> But we may law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully love natural ſelf, ſoul and body; becauſe theſe are the works of God, and therefore good.</p>
            <p>He that came to deſtroy the works of the Devil, came to ſave the ſoul and body,<note place="margin">Luke 19.10.</note> the works of God. <hi>The Son of man is come to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A man may love his own body, and is bound to preſerve the life of it; <hi>no man ever yet hated his own fleſh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5.29. Mark 5.5. 1 Kings 18.28.</note> We read indeed of one out of the tombs, <hi>who was day and night in the Mountains, and in the tombs, crying, and cutting himſelf with ſtones:</hi> and of the Idolatrous <hi>Baalites,</hi> (who ſacrificed to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and not to God,) <hi>that they cut themſelves, after their manner, with knives, and launcers, till the blood guſhed out upon them:</hi> but who in his right wits e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſuch a thing? or where did God require it at any mans hands? The Lord forbids the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to make ſuch barbarous cuttings and manglings of their fleſh (after the manner of the heathen) becauſe they were his ſervants.<note place="margin">Lev. 19.28.</note> A man may ſin againſt his own body many ways; as by exceſſive labour, neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting to take neceſſary food, or phyſick; intemperance, and the like: <hi>He
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:95740:29"/> that committeth fornication, ſinneth againſt his own body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A man may and ought chiefly to love his own Soul. Every mans care ſhould be that it may be well with his better part, both here and hereafter. And to this purpoſe it is every ones great concern (1). To get into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who is that ark in which only Souls can be ſafe. They who after all the calls, invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and beſeechings of God in the Goſpel, will perſiſt and go on in impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitency and unbelief, are murderers of their own Souls, and their blood will be upon their own heads: <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me, wrongeth his own ſoul;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 8.36.</note> 
               <hi>all they that hate me, love death.</hi> (2.<note place="margin">John 15.4.

            <p>The new nature, or <hi>ſpiritual ſelf,</hi> is the beſt ſelf we have; and ſhould be moſt of all loved by us. They that have the charge of others Soules, are a Part of their own charge: <hi>Take heed to your ſelves and to all the flock.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note> They who are under the inſpection of others, muſt look to themſelves alſo; ſo <hi>John</hi> chargeth that Elect Lady and her Children,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.12.</note> to whom he wrote his ſecond epiſtle, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. <hi>look to your ſelves.</hi> As Paſtors muſt give an account of their flock, ſo every ſheep of the flock muſt give an account of himſelf: <hi>Every one of us ſhall give an account of himſelf to God.</hi>

To this end God hath placed affections in mans Soul, that he might uſe them as feet, to carry him forth readily to that which <hi>is</hi> good, and from that which <hi>is</hi> evil or hurtful to him.

            <p n="3">3. We come now, in the third place, to lay down four ſhort concluſions about our love to God, our Neighbour, and our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Conclu.</hi> The firſt <hi>is</hi> this; that <hi>as</hi> God <hi>is</hi> to be loved above all things elſe, ſo he <hi>is</hi> to be loved for himſelf. <hi>There is none good but one, that is, God:</hi> None originally, independently, eſſentially and immutably good but he; and therefore he only <hi>is</hi> to be loved for himſelf. It was well ſaid by one of the Ancients<note n="(i)" place="margin">Bernardus.</note>, <hi>Cauſa diligendi Deum, Deus eſt: modus, ſine modo diligere. The cauſe of loving God, is God himſelf: The meaſure, is to love him without mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Conclu.</hi> That Creatures may be loved according to that degree of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which God hath communicated to them, not for themſelves, but for God,<note place="margin">Prov. 16.4.</note> 
               <hi>who made all things for himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As all waters come from the Sea, and go through many places and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, not reſting any where till they return to the Sea again: So our love, if it be right, hath its riſe in God, acts towards ſeveral Creatures, in due manner and meaſure, but reſts in God at laſt, bringing into him all the Glory of that goodneſs, which he hath derived to the Creatures, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whatſoever you do, do all to the glory of God.</hi> We may neither love our ſelves, nor our neighbours, for our, or themſelves<note n="(k)" place="margin">Amor fruen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di quibuſcunque crea uris, ſine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Conclu.</hi> No man can love himſelf, or his neighbour aright, while he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in a ſtate of ſin: until a man come to himſelf, he cannot love him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, or any other man as he ought: the reaſon <hi>is</hi> manifeſt from what was ſaid before<note n="l" place="margin">Amor Dei, quo pervenitur ad Deum, non eſt niſi à Deo Patre, per Jeſum Chriſtum, eum Spiritu Sancto. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> contr. <hi>Jul.</hi> lib. 4. Gal. 5.22. Eph. 6.23.</note>; He doth not, he cannot love either, in God and for God: when the Prodigal came to himſelf, and not till then, he ſaid, I will return to my Father.</p>
            <p>Love <hi>is</hi> a fruit of the Spirit, and therefore <hi>is</hi> never found in any who are deſtitute of the Spirit. The grace of Love flows from Faith, and therefore the Apoſtle prayed for the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> that they might have <hi>faith and love, from God the Father and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Conclu.</hi> The moſt gracious ſouls on earth, though they may, and do love God, themſelves, and their Neighbours truly and ſincerely; yet, by reaſon of the relicts of corruption in their hearts, there are many<note n="m" place="margin">Qualis eſt fidei habitus, talis eſt &amp; charitatis; ſi fideihabitus eſſet perfectus, Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatis habitus eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet etiam per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectus. <hi>Camero.</hi> 1 Theſſ. 3.10.</note> defects in their love to

            <p>Firſt, <hi>In and by the things</hi> that we do, and may ſhew love to our ſelves, we ought to ſhew love to others: It <hi>is</hi> not poſſible to enumerate all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances, wherein we ſhew love to our ſelves; It ſhall ſuffice therefore that we ſpeak of ſuch things <hi>as</hi> are inducive of many more: We ſhall reduce them to theſe Four heads.</p>

We may be much more bold to judge our ſelves than others; we are privy to our own principles, from whence our words and actions flow, and to our own intentions in all we ſpeak or do: But the caſe <hi>is</hi> otherwiſe, when we take upon us to judge others; their principles and intentions are known only to themſelves, until they ſome way or other declare them: the heart, being the hidden Man, <hi>is</hi> known only to God, <hi>before whom all things are naked and open,</hi> and to a mans ſelf: <hi>What</hi> man <hi>knoweth the things of a man, ſave the ſpirit of man, which is in him?</hi> Moreover, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate ſelf-love hath often too great an influence on the judgment we paſs upon our ſelves; and the corruption of our wills and affections, on the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we paſs upon other men, that we ſeldom judge aright. As he that hath the jaundiſe, be the object never ſo white, judgeth it yellow, his eye being ill diſpoſed: ſo the eye of the mind, being affected with the corruption of the heart, puts another colour upon that, which <hi>is</hi> moſt candidly ſpoken or done.

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="54" facs="tcp:95740:31"/>2. We ſhew our love to our ſelves, in and by our <hi>ſpeeches</hi> concerning our ſelves, and it is our duty ſo to do. As we ought not to paſs too ſevere a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on our ſelves, in our own minds; ſo we may not ſpeak that which is falſe, of our ſelves: and it is ſeldom known, that any mans tongue falls foul up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf. Yea, our love to our ſelves, is, and ought to be ſuch, as not to ſuffer our tongue to blab, and ſend abroad all the evil we certainly know by our ſelves.</p>
            <p>It is our duty then in the ſame matter to ſhew our love to others: Our tongue, which is apt to ſpeak the beſt of our ſelves, ſhould not frame it ſelf to ſpeak the worſt we can of our Brethren. The Apoſtle chargeth <hi>Titus</hi>
               <note place="margin">Titus. 3.2</note> to put Chriſtians in mind of this, among other duties; <hi>to ſpeak evil of no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There are ſeveral ways and degrees of evil ſpeaking:</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt, and moſt notorious, is, when men are ſpoken againſt as evil do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, for doing that which is their duty to do; When they are condemned for that, for which they ought to be commended: Thus was <hi>Jeremiah</hi> dealt with in his time, when he faithfully declared the mind of God to the people;<note place="margin">Jer. 18.18.</note> 
               <hi>Come</hi> (ſay they) <hi>and let us ſmite him with the tongue:</hi> The ſame lot had <hi>John</hi> from <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> who prated againſt him with Malicious words, becauſe he had wrote to have the brethren received, a work of Chriſtian love and Charity, which he had no heart unto. To ſpeak evil of others for that which is their duty, is a common thing among men; and too ordinary among ſome profeſſors; If they be told of a truth, or exhorted to a duty, that doth not agree with their private opinion, and Comport with their carnal intereſt, how do their hearts riſe, and their mouths begin to open againſt ſuch as declare it to them! We may well conceive, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſome ſuch thing in his days, when we find him beſeeching Chriſtians to <hi>ſuffer the word of exhortation:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 13.22. 1 Pet. 2.1.</note> and the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo, by his charging them (in hearing) <hi>to lay aſide, all malice, and all guile and hypocriſies, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies, and evil-ſpeakings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecond way of evil ſpeaking, and a great ſin againſt love and Charity, is, when men raiſe up falſe reports of others, or ſet them forward when others have maliciouſly raiſed them.</p>
            <p>To offend in this kind is a great breach of a Chriſtians good behaviour, as the Apoſtle intimates,<note place="margin">Titus 2.3.</note> when he ſaith; <hi>That they be in behaviour as becometh Holineſs</hi>

            <p n="2">2. They alſo are Guilty, and more guilty of evil ſpeaking than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, who endeavour to bring others into ſin, rather than they will want matter againſt them: Thus the malicious Phariſees did their utmoſt to cauſe Chriſt himſelf (had it been poſſible) to offend, <hi>urging him vehemently, and provoking him to ſpeak of many things, ſeeking to catch ſomething out of his mouth, that they might accuſe him.</hi>

            <p n="3">3.

We have ſeen now in what <hi>things</hi> we do and may ſhew love to our ſelves: we come now to ſpeak of the <hi>manner</hi> of loving our ſelves, and to ſhew that after the ſame manner we ought to love others alſo. 1. We do, or ſhould love our ſelves holily, <hi>i. e.</hi> in and for God: we may not have a divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded intereſt from God; though God allows us to love our ſelves, it muſt be in order to him, and to his Glory. Our love to our ſelves, as it muſt be regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the will of God, and extended or reſtrained according to that; So God muſt be our utmoſt end in it, whether it be exerciſed about the obtaining things temporal or ſpiritual, for body or ſoul: Salvation it ſelf, although it be our end, muſt not be our laſt or utmoſt end: but that God by it, as by all things elſe may be glorified. Therefore in this manner we muſt love others, as God hath an intereſt in them, and is, or may be glorified by them: and there is no man in the world, but God is or may be glorified by him. Every man is a creature, upon whoſe Soul there is, in a ſort, the Image of God, and doth him ſome ſervice in the place wherein he ſtands.<note place="margin">Iſa. 44.28. and 45.1.</note> God calleth <hi>Cyrus</hi> a heathen, his <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and his <hi>Anointed,</hi> and he did him eminent ſervice in his generation. The ſame may be ſaid of every other man, in ſome degree and proportion: God hath given him ſome gifts, whereby he is and may be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to him, at leaſt in the affairs of his providential kingdom. Beſides; all men, having immortal ſouls within them, are capable of bleſſedneſs with God for ever in the kingdom of Glory: they who are at preſent enemies to God may be reconciled and made friends: what was the moſt glorious Saint now in heaven, but an enemy to God once, when here on earth? <hi>We our ſelves</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>were ſometime fooliſh, diſobedient, deceived,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Our love to our ſelves is, or ſhould be orderly: we muſt firſt and chiefly love our ſouls, and then our bodies. The Soul is of far greater worth than the body. A world of things for the body will ſtand a man in no ſtead if his ſoul be loſt; and where the ſoul goes, either to a place of bliſs, or tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the body muſt follow after: and therefore when we are charged to take heed to our ſelves, we are charged to keep our ſouls diligently; <hi>only take heed to thy ſelf,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. We muſt ſeek the converſion of thoſe that are unconverted, leſt their ſouls be loſt for ever. If we can be inſtrumental in this, we ſhew the greateſt love imaginable: to give a man bread when he is hungry, or cloathing when he is naked, is ſomthing; but to convert a ſoul to God, is a greater kindneſs by much. <hi>Brethren,</hi>

               <hi>if any of you do err from the truth and one convert him, let him know, that he which converteth a ſinner from the error of his way ſhall ſave a ſoul from death:</hi> He ſpeaks of it as a great thing, when he ſays, <hi>Let him know, that he ſhall ſave a</hi> ſoul <hi>from death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We ſhould ſhew our love to the ſouls of others, by ſeeking and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring the encreaſe of their Faith, Holineſs and comfort: as we ſhould not be content to go to heaven alone, but carry along with us as many as we can, ſo we ſhould not ſatisfie our ſelves to ſee them creep lamely thither, but gird up the loins of their minds for them, that they may more ſtrenuouſly, and with the more chearfulneſs and comfort walk thither. Thus <hi>John</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to bring the Saints to higher degrees of fellowſhip with God:<note place="margin">1 John 1.3.</note>

            <p n="5">5. We do not only love our ſelves truely and ſincerely, but with ſome fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vency: there is always ſome heat, as well as heart, in love to our ſelves: you may obſerve it ordinarily, that when ſelf is concerned in any thing, that affection which is moved about it, hath ſome heat in it; if it be anger, there is heat in anger; if it be love, there is heat in love. Indeed all men are very apt to exceed, and go much beyond their bounds when ſelf is concerned, as if they were to love themſelves with all their hearts, with all their ſoul,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 18.1.</note> and with all their mind: however, it is allowable that a man be warm in love to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, eſpecially to his ſoul which is the beſt part of himſelf.

In which regard <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>to reſt contented, and ſatisfied in any object, ſo as not to ſeek out for any thing more,</hi> in point of happineſs. In this ſtrict and peculiar notion, conſidered as
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:95740:36"/> to both its branches, we muſt underſtand <hi>Love</hi> here, both as to the <hi>world</hi> and <hi>the Father.</hi> And ſo the love of the world, and the love of the Father are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly oppoſite, and therefore inconſiſtent each with other, in this ſtrict no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wherein <hi>John</hi> takes them.</p>
            <p>This is farther evident from that great Aphoriſm of our Lord, Mat. 6.24. <hi>No man can ſerve two maſters: For either he will hate the one and Love the other,</hi> &amp;c. Where we find <gap reason="foreign">

So that when <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>love not the world,</hi> it muſt be underſtood in this proper notion of love, as it includes a <hi>predominant</hi> and <hi>prevalent</hi> degree; and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with it the <hi>Bent</hi> and force of the will, either in a way of active <hi>proſecution</hi> of the world if abſent, or delightful complacential <hi>Acquieſcence</hi> therein if en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Such a love to the world is no other than <hi>Concupiſcence,</hi> or luſt, and ſo altogether inconſiſtent with the love of the Father, as <hi>John</hi> argueth. All this will be more evident, when we come to explicate the things contained under theſe terms, namely Love to God, and the World.</p>
            <p>The next thing to be explicated by us, is the <hi>Object</hi> of this prohibition; which is <hi>the World,</hi> and <hi>the things therein.</hi> The Greek name <gap reason="foreign">

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to adorn:</hi> it being, as it were, an houſe, hung with all manner of rich and beautiful or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments, of Divine <hi>Wiſdom, Power,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> Rom. 1.20. and in this regard the World is, in its kind and meaſure, amiable and love-worthy, But <hi>John</hi> ſeems to take the <hi>World</hi> here in a more limited and narrow ſenſe, as it is the fuel of Luſt, and repugnant to, and incoherent with the Father. For as I before premiſed, it is uſual with <hi>John</hi> to make uſe of notions, which are of a lax and general import, in a more ſtrict and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined ſenſe. Thus 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God doth not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin.</hi> Which muſt be underſtood in a ſtrict confined <hi>ſence,</hi> i. e. with a plenitude of will, as wicked men do. So in our text, <hi>love not,</hi> i. e. in a ſtrict ſenſe, with a plenitude, and Bent of heart. <hi>The world,</hi> i. e. for it ſelf, as the fuel of luſt, and contrary to God. There is a regular and lawful love of the world, when it is in an inferior degree, and in ſubordination to God; but that which <hi>John</hi> here prohibits, is an irregular and inordinate love to the world for it ſelf, in competition with, or oppoſition to the love of the Father, as <hi>v.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>Hence it follows: <hi>neither the things that are in the World.</hi> (1). Here we are again to take notice of another peculiar Idiom frequent with <hi>John,</hi> both in his Goſpel and Epiſtles, namely, to reiterate the ſame thing under different expreſſions, partly by way of <hi>Exegeſis,</hi> and partly to give an Emphatick ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude. It might have ſufficed, that he had ſaid, <hi>love not the world:</hi> But the more fully to explicate his mind, as alſo to give an Emphaſe, and Accent to what he had ſaid, he adds, <hi>neither the things that are in the world.</hi> He con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:95740:37"/> not himſelf with <hi>Generals,</hi> but deſcends to <hi>Particulars;</hi> which he more fully ſpecifies, <hi>v.</hi> 16. (2). <hi>By things that are in the world,</hi> we may, in a more ſtrict and confined notion, underſtand thoſe things, which worldly men do moſt magnifie and Idolize: Mundane <hi>Grandeur, Pomp, Glory, Riches, Pleaſures, Honours, Friends,</hi> whatever elſe may Captivate the hearts of degenerate men. In ſum, by <hi>the world, and the things that are in the world,</hi> muſt be underſtood, all <hi>ſenſible, natural, civil,</hi> yea <hi>mental</hi> Goods, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is inferior to God, ſo far as it may ſtand in Oppoſition to, or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with him; and ſo prove matter of abuſe, and fuel for Luſt, as <hi>ver.</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>It follows: <hi>If any man love the world.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>If,</hi> here is <hi>cauſal</hi> and <hi>rational,</hi> ſignifying as much as, <hi>For,</hi> or <hi>Becauſe if:</hi> and ſo it points out, and uſhers in the main Cauſe or Reaſon, why we are not <hi>to love the world,</hi> namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>he that Loves the world hath not the love of the Father in him.</hi> As if he had ſaid: Alas! are not the <hi>World,</hi> and the <hi>Father</hi> perfectly oppoſite? Do they not both require the whole Heart, yea, the whole man, as Mat. 6.24? Is it poſſible then, that he who loves the world at ſuch a rate, can love the Father? Or we may take the words thus: <hi>If any man Love the world,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>i. e.</hi> ſo far as any man loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. And in this ſenſe it will reach all, both Saints and Sinners. Though I take the words chiefly to be underſtood of predominant love to the world, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inconſiſtent with love to God.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, there lies ſomething peculiar in that phraſe, <hi>The Love of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is not in him.</hi> (1) Here we find another Idiom, or manner of ſpeech proper to <hi>John,</hi> who frequently makes uſe of Antitheſes, and that both of <hi>Things, Words,</hi> and <hi>Sentences,</hi> for Illuſtration, and Confirmation; whereof many Inſtances might be given, as <hi>John</hi> 1.5, 13, 17, 20, &amp;c. So here he op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the <hi>Father</hi> to the <hi>World:</hi> And then <hi>the Love of the Father,</hi> to <hi>the Love of the world;</hi> which gives great Illuſtration and Demonſtration to his diſcourſe: For oppoſites illuſtrate and demonſtrate each other. (2) Another thing to be conſidered herein is the object, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>of the Father.</hi> Where the Article <hi>THE,</hi> deſerves a peculiar regard: and ſo in deed do the various Articles in this text, <hi>The world, the Things,</hi> &amp;c. For albeit theſe <hi>Articles</hi> ſometimes, in other parts of Scripture, are not ſignificative or emphatick, yet here they ſeem to give ſome emphaſe. So that <hi>The Father</hi> is here mentioned to ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie both the <hi>proper Object,</hi> and <hi>Formal Reaſon</hi> of <hi>Evangelick</hi> Love, as diſtinct from that <hi>Natural</hi> Love, which <hi>Adam</hi> in Paradiſe had towards God, as <hi>Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator.</hi> Firſt by <hi>the Father</hi> here is ſpecified the proper object of Evangelick love, namely that it muſt terminate on God, as a gracious Father in and through Chriſt; whereas <hi>Adam's</hi> natural love in Innocence terminated on God only as Creator. Secondly by <hi>the Father</hi> alſo the <hi>formal Reaſon</hi> of Evangelick Love is ſpecified, namely that God's love towards us in Chriſt ought to be the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal reaſon, or <hi>proper motive</hi> of our love to him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) As for the Act, <hi>the love,</hi> it may be taken either <hi>paſſively</hi> and <hi>Octjectively,</hi> for the Father's Love ſhed abroad in the heart, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. or elſe <hi>ſubjective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>actively,</hi> for our Love to the Father. This latter I take to be prima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily intended.</p>
            <pb n="67" facs="tcp:95740:37"/>
            <p>The words thus explicated admit this <hi>Logick Diviſion.</hi> We find in them firſt a <hi>prohibition;</hi> and then the <hi>reaſon</hi> thereof annext. In the prohibition we have. (1). The <hi>Act Love not.</hi> (2). The <hi>Object,</hi> and this. (1). In the <hi>General, the World.</hi> (2). In its <hi>Particularities. neither the things that are in the world.</hi> The chief whereof are ſpecified, <hi>v.</hi> 16. As for the reaſon of the prohibition, it is wrapped up in an Hypothetick propoſition, which is eaſily reduced to a Catagorick Syllogiſm thus: two loves perfectly oppoſite can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conſiſt together in one and the ſame heart: but love to the world, and love to the Father are perfectly oppoſite: therefore he that loves the world hath not the love of the Father in him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>What love in its general Idea imports?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sect. 2. A general Character of Love.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The words thus explicated, contain in them this great Truth, <hi>That a prevalent predominant Love to the World is altogether inconſiſtent with the Love of God.</hi> Hence alſo there is offered to us this practick caſe of Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, <hi>wherein the love of the World is inconſiſent with the love of God?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reſolution of this ſo weighty a caſe, depends much on the explication of its parts; which we ſhall endeavour to examine, and open under theſe three Queſtions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>What Love in its general Idea, or nature doth import?</hi> 2. <hi>What it is to Love the world?</hi> 3. <hi>What it is to love God?</hi> theſe queſtions being explicated the reſolution of our caſe will be facile and obvious.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Queſt. What Love in its general Idea or Nature doth import?</hi> this queſtion being more <hi>Philoſophick</hi> than <hi>Theologick,</hi> we ſhall not much inſiſt thereon. But to clear up our way to the following queſtions, we may take up this conciſe Character, or Idea of Love, as abſtracted from this or that ſubject. Love is the moſt vigorous, potent, imperious and ſoveraign affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the humane ſoul; which has its Royal ſeat in the <hi>Will,</hi> or rather in the ſoul as <hi>willing what is Good.</hi> For albeit I cannot conceive how the Will and Underſtanding may be really diſtinguiſhed, more than by their <hi>formal Objects</hi> and <hi>Acts;</hi> yet I can eaſily grant, the ſoul, as willing what is good, to be the proper Subject and ſeat of Love. Not but that there is alſo <hi>paſſion</hi> of Love, or ſomething analogous to Love, in the <hi>ſenſitive ſoul,</hi> or <hi>Animal</hi> part. But this is more <hi>Paſſionate,</hi> that in the humane ſoul more <hi>Rational:</hi> this more <hi>raſh;</hi> that more <hi>deliberate:</hi> this more <hi>ſuperficial</hi> and <hi>tranſient;</hi> that more <hi>rooted</hi> and <hi>fixed:</hi> this more <hi>confuſed</hi> and <hi>difform;</hi> that more <hi>uniform</hi> and <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual:</hi> this more <hi>carnal;</hi> that more <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> in its objects and motions: this more <hi>brutiſh</hi> and <hi>ſervile;</hi> that more <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>voluntary,</hi> ſpecially if regular.</p>
            <p>Now love thus ſeated in the will, or ſoul, as willing, governs the whole ſoul, with all the faculties, or rather Acts, thereof. As the will governs all inferior faculties, ſo is ſhe governed by her love; which renders her what ſhe is, as to good or evil. What the Love is, that the man is: and where the love is, there the man is. If thy love be in Heaven, there thou art; and if thy love be in Hell, thou art there. For where the Treaſure is, there the love, heart, and man is, <hi>Math.</hi> 6.21. And as Love governs the whole ſoul in general, ſo has ſhe a more particular influence or the <hi>Affections,</hi> both <hi>ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional</hi> and <hi>paſſionate.</hi> Love indeed is not only the <hi>prime,</hi> but alſo the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſource and ſpring of all humane affections; which owe their <hi>Being, Life,</hi>
               <pb n="68" facs="tcp:95740:38"/> and <hi>Motion</hi> thereto. What are all Affections but the ſeveral <hi>forms</hi> and ſhape of Love? whence have they their tincture and colour but from it? for look a-the object beloved is affected with this or that circumſtance; ſo is Love proportionably inveſted with this or that form. If the object beloved be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, love goes forth to meet it by <hi>Deſire;</hi> if preſent, love ſolaceth it ſelf there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in by <hi>Fruition</hi> and <hi>Delight;</hi> if it be under hazards, love waxeth pale with <hi>Fear;</hi> if the enjoyment thereof be impeded or obſtructed by others, Love grows <hi>angry;</hi> if it be loſt, Love clotheth her ſelf with black <hi>ſorrow;</hi> if there be a probability or but poſſibility ſometimes of enjoying it, love moves towards it by <hi>Hope.</hi> Thus love puts on ſundry <hi>forms,</hi> and Aſpects, which we call affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, according to the ſundry poſtures of its beloved. In ſhort, look as the wife changeth her condition into that of her husband, and becomes noble or ignoble, according to his condition; ſo love changeth her condition accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that of the object ſhe doth eſpouſe: if love eſpouſe God for her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, then doth ſhe become ſpiritual, Noble, and Divine, according to the quality of God; but if ſhe Elect and adhere to the world, then doth ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come carnal, baſe, and worldly. So much for the general Idea of Love, of which more in what follows.</p>

            <p>Love to the world may be conſidered as <hi>Predominant,</hi> and ſo altogether inconſiſtent with the very being and exiſtence of love to God; or elſe as infirm and in part ſubdued. We ſhall here treat of it in the former reſpect only, which ſeems chiefly intended by <hi>John.</hi> And ſo love to the <hi>world</hi> may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. <hi>A certain habitual pondus or weight of concupiſcence, and Luſt, whereby the ſoul is ſtrongly impelled and inclined towards the fruition of, and ſatisfaction in the world, as its laſt end, and chiefeſt Good.</hi> In this deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of love to the world, we find its <hi>Object, ſubject, end, principle, Act</hi> and <hi>meaſure;</hi> which will all fall under a more particular conſideration in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">The Object of predominant love to the world.</note>1. <hi>Prop. To love the world is to affect ſome private, particular inferiour.

(2). <hi>Negatively,</hi> when, though it be loved only as a partial <hi>good,</hi> yet it is loved for it ſelf, and not referred to God, either <hi>actually</hi> or <hi>habitually,</hi> as the ſupreme <hi>good.</hi> Such is the curſed love of many worldly profeſſors, who love the world only as a <hi>partial good,</hi> yet ſo, as they refer it not to God the ſupreme <hi>good;</hi> and therefore may be ſaid to love it for it ſelf, as their laſt <hi>end</hi> and chiefeſt <hi>good, negatively,</hi> though not <hi>poſitively.</hi> This love to the world for it ſelf, as the <hi>laſt end,</hi> and chiefeſt <hi>good,</hi> is fully deſcribed by <hi>John</hi> in the verſe following our text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16. <hi>For all that is in the world, the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but it is of the world.</hi> Theſe words give much light and evidence to our text and preſent ſubject; wherefore we ſhall a little inſiſt on the explication of them.</p>
            <pb n="69" facs="tcp:95740:38"/>
            <p>And (1) We are to conſider their <hi>rational</hi> connexion with the words prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, included in the particle <hi>For:</hi> which gives us the genuine reaſon and cauſe, why the love of the world is inconſiſtent with the Love of God; namely, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all that is in the world, whether <hi>ſenſible, Civil,</hi> or <hi>Mental</hi> Goods, ſo far as they are the fuel of Luſts, <hi>are not of the Father, but of the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2) We are to obſerve here, that <hi>John</hi> diſcourſing of worldly goods, as the fuel of our Luſt, expreſſeth the things themſelves by the luſt in us. He ſaith not <hi>Pleaſures, Riches, Honours,</hi> though theſe be the things he means; but the <hi>Luſt</hi> of theſe things; becauſe the poiſon and evil of theſe things comes not from the things themſelves, but from our luſts, that run into, and live upon them, as our laſt end and choiceſt good. And in this ſenſe, ſaith <hi>John, they are not of the Father, but of the World.</hi> i. e. God never made or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed theſe inferiour goods to be our laſt end, chiefeſt Good, or matter of fruition and ſatisfaction; no, it is the Luſts of worldly men that have put this Crown upon the Heads of Pleaſures, profits, preferments, &amp;c. Hence it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally follows that all love to theſe lower goods, for themſelves, as our Laſt end and chiefeſt Good, is but Concupiſcence or inordinate Luſt. For indeed what is Luſt, but deſire to, or fruition of the Creature for it ſelf? (3) We are to conſider likewiſe the Diſtribution, which <hi>John</hi> here makes, of all that is in the world, into <hi>the Luſt of the Fleſh, the Luſt of the eyes, and the pride of Life.</hi> This, as they ſay, is the worldly man's <hi>Trinity</hi> which he doth ſo much Idolize and Adore.<note n="(a)" place="margin">

The world commands you to engage no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in matters of Religion, than may conſiſt with its Intereſt: But Chriſt commands you to part with all worldly Intereſt for himſelf. The world com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands you to take your fill of the creature; to ſuck out the ſweets thereof, and feed your hearts therewith: But Chriſt commands you to <hi>uſe this world as if you uſed it not;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31. to affect an univerſal privation of theſe lower goods, even whilſt you enjoy them; to give periſhing things, periſhing thoughts, eſteem, and deſires; to bid farewell to all things, ſo far as they are a ſnare to you, or a ſacrifice that God calls for. Again, the world commands you to endeavour the greatning of your names and reputation: But Chriſt commands you to glory in nothing but his Croſs; to account abaſement for Chriſt your greateſt Honour. Laſtly the world commandeth you not to be ſcrupulous about ſmall ſins; but to take your liberry, and latitude: But Chriſt commandeth you to dread the leaſt ſin more than the greateſt ſuffering. Now, how contrary and Inconſiſtent are theſe Maſters in their Commands? Is it poſſible then, that we ſhould be Maſters of ſuch contrary Loves? O! how doth love to the world eat out love to God?</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Predominant Love to the world is inconſiſtent with the Love of God, in that it robs God of that Love and Honour, which is due to him as the Soveraign Chiefeſt Good.</hi> according to what meaſure the heart turns to the world and its concerns, in the ſame meaſure it turns from God and his concerns. When the heart is full of the world, how ſoon is all ſenſe of, and love to God choaked? how is the Mind bemiſted, an Will charmed with the painted heart-bewitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhadows of the World? This was <hi>Iſrael's</hi> Caſe, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.1. <hi>Iſrael is an empty vine,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">

Expoſitors have variety of Conceptions on theſe words; but the moſt ſimple ſenſe ſeems this <hi>Iſrael:</hi> is<note n="(ſ)" place="margin">vitis eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuans.</note> an <hi>evacuant luxuriant Vine,</hi> which ſeems to bring forth ſuch abundance of fruit, as if ſhe would empty her ſelf of all her juice and fruits at once; ſo richly laden with fruit doth ſhe ſeem to be. Ay, but what fruit is it? Surely <hi>fruit unto her ſelf,</hi> rotten corrupt fruit: her heart and love is not beſtowed on God, but on her Idols. So it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, <hi>v.</hi> 2. <hi>Their heart is divided. i. e.</hi> This beloved Idol hath one part, that another: and thus God is robbed of that eſteem and love which is due to him.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) <hi>Love to the World breeds Confidence in the World, whereby the heart is turned off from its Dependence on God, as its firſt cauſe.</hi> And O! how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent is this with the love of God? God, as he is our <hi>Laſt End</hi> in point of <hi>Fruition,</hi> ſo alſo our <hi>firſt principle,</hi> or <hi>Cauſe</hi> in point of <hi>Dependence.</hi> Now love to the world turns the heart from God to the World, not only as the <hi>laſt end,</hi> but alſo as the <hi>Firſt Cauſe.</hi> They that love the world caſt the weight of their ſouls, and chiefeſt concerns on the World; and ſo bid Adieu to God. This Confidence in worldly things is inconſiſtent with Salvation, and ſo with the Love of God; as <hi>Mark</hi> 10.24. <hi>How hard is it for them that truſt in riches to enter into the Kingdom of God?</hi> This <hi>Rhetorick</hi> Interrogati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on implies a <hi>Logick</hi> negation, namely, that it is impoſſible for one, that in a <hi>prevalent degree</hi> truſteth in his riches, to enter into the Kingdom of God. So <hi>Pſal.</hi> 52.7. <hi>Lo this is the man that made not God his ſtrength; but truſted
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:95740:42"/> in the abundance of his riches, and ſtrengthned, (or fortified) himſelf in his wickedneſs (or ſubſtance.)</hi> The like <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.15. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17.</p>
            <p n="4">(4). <hi>Love to the world is flat idolatry, and herein alſo inconſiſtent with the Love of God.</hi> So <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.5. <hi>nor Covetous man, who is an Idolater.</hi> The ſame <hi>Col.</hi> 3.5. <hi>and covetouſneſs, which is idolatry.</hi> Covetouſneſs is, in a peculiar manner, branded with this black mark of Idolatry, in that it doth expreſly proclaim a love to the world as its <hi>laſt end,</hi> and confidence in it as its <hi>firſt cauſe.</hi> So <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of voluptuous perſons, that <hi>they make their belly their God, Phil.</hi> 3.19. becauſe they <hi>love pleaſures more than God,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4. And indeed every lover of the world is a <hi>God-maker:</hi> ſo many luſts as men have, ſo many <hi>Gods.</hi> The luſt of the fleſh makes <hi>pleaſures</hi> its God; the luſt of the eye worſhips <hi>Riches</hi> as its God; and the luſt of <hi>pride</hi> exalts ſome crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted excellence in the place of God. O! how do worldlings loſe the true God in the croud of falſe Gods?</p>
            <p n="5">(5). <hi>Love to the world is ſpiritual Adultery; and thence incoherent with the Love of God.</hi> The jealouſie of God will not admit of any corrival in the bent of the heart: but Oh! how doth love to this world run a whoring after other Lovers,? ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.17, 18, 38. and 23.5, 11. <hi>and Aholah played the harlot when ſhe mas mine,</hi> &amp;c. The like <hi>James</hi> 4.4. <hi>Ye adulterers, and adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſſes, know ye not, that the friendſh;p of the world is enmity with God?</hi> Which implies, that love to, and friendſhip with this whoriſh world, is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Adultery, and ſo hatred againſt God. O! how ſoon are thoſe that love the world killed by its adulterous imbraces? hence,</p>
            <p n="6">(6). <hi>Love to the world is a deliberate contrived luſt, and ſo habitual enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and rebellion againſt God. Acts</hi> of luſt, which ariſe from ſuddain paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, though violent, may conſiſt with the love of God; but a deliberate Bent of heart towards the world, as our ſupreme intereſt, cannot. The ſingle act of a groſs ſin, ariſing from ſome prevalent Temptation, ſpeaketh not ſuch an inveterate bitter root of enmity againſt God, as predominant love to the world, <hi>James</hi> 4.4. <hi>whoſoever therefore will be the friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</hi> Oh! how much of contempt, rebellion, and enmity againſt God, is there in friendſhip and love to the world?</p>
            <p n="7">(7) <hi>Love to the world forms our profeſſion into a ſubſervience unto our worldly intereſt, and ſo makes Religion to ſtoop unto, yea truckle under luſt.</hi> Now what can be more inconſiſtent with the Love of God, than this? This was the caſe of the carnal Jews, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.31. <hi>With their mouth they ſhew much love, but their heart goeth after their covetouſneſs.</hi> They ſhew much love in <hi>profeſſion;</hi> but O; how little have they of ſincere <hi>affection?</hi> and why? becauſe their <hi>avaricious</hi> hearts made the whole of their profeſſion to conform to their worldly intereſt? Thus alſo it was with unbelieving Jews in our Lords time, <hi>John</hi> 5.42. <hi>But I know you, that ye have not the love of God in you. I know you.</hi> There lies a great emphaſe in that, <hi>you; you,</hi> who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs ſo much, and yet have ſo little love <hi>in you.</hi> They had much love to God in their <hi>mouth,</hi> but none in their <hi>heart:</hi> this appeareth by <hi>v.</hi> 43, 44. where our Lord tells them in plain terms, that their worldly <hi>honour,</hi> and <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt</hi> was the only meaſure of their profeſſion. This alſo was the meaſure of
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:95740:43"/> 
               <hi>Judas's</hi> Religion, <hi>John</hi> 12.5, 6. where he <hi>pretends</hi> much love to the poor, but really <hi>intends</hi> nothing, but the gratifying his <hi>avaricious humor.</hi> The like, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 10.11. <hi>Ephraim loveth to tread out the Corn,</hi> &amp;c. becauſe there was <hi>profit, liberty, and pleaſure</hi> in that, but <hi>Ephaim</hi> loved not <hi>plowing work;</hi> becauſe that brought her under a yoke, and brought in no advantage to her.</p>
            <p>Love to the world brings us under <hi>ſubjection</hi> to it, and ſo takes us off from the <hi>ſervice</hi> of God. What we inordinately love and cleave unto, we are ſoon overcome by. Now ſubjection to the world, and ſubjection to God are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.24.</p>
            <p n="8">(8). <hi>Love to the world is the root of all ſin; and therefore what more incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the love of God? To love God is to hate evil, Pſal.</hi> 97.10. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>to love evil,</hi> either in the <hi>cauſe</hi> or <hi>effect,</hi> is to hate God. Now love to the world has not only a <hi>love</hi> for, but alſo a <hi>cauſal influence</hi> on all ſin. And that, (1) As it expoſeth men to the violent incurſion and aſſaults of every <hi>tentation,</hi> ſo 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. <hi>But they that will be rich.</hi>

Love to the world <hi>ſtifles all convictions,</hi> breaks all chains and bars of reſtraining grace, and ſo opens a more effectual door to all ſin. We find a prodigious example hereof in <hi>Balaam, Numb.</hi> 22.22, 40. where you ſee at large, how his predominant love to the <hi>wages of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. ſtifled all thoſe powerful convictions of, and reſolutions againſt ſin he lay under. (4). Love to the world is the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe</hi> and <hi>death</hi> of the ſoul, and therefore the <hi>life</hi> of ſin, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.6. <hi>ſhe that liveth in pleaſure is dead, while ſhe liveth,</hi> (5).

               <hi>pollutes</hi> our whole Being. <hi>Animal</hi> paſſions defile the ſoul: inordinate luſtings after things lawful pollute the moſt of profeſſors, more or leſs. (6). Love to the world puts the whole ſoul, yea world, into <hi>Wars, Confuſion,</hi> and <hi>Diſorders,</hi> ſo <hi>James</hi> 4.1. <hi>From whence come wars, and fightings among you? come they not hence, even of your luſts, that war in your Members?</hi>

Now all intern wars and diſorders are inconſiſtent with the love of God, which is peaceable and orderly. In theſe regards love to the world im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedes and hinders the love of God.</p>
            <p n="9">
               <pb n="79" facs="tcp:95740:43"/>(9). <hi>Love to the world is inconſiſtent with the love of God, in that it cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Apoſtaſie from God.</hi> The <hi>Converſion</hi> of the heart to the Creature, always implies its <hi>Averſion</hi> from God: He that cannot part with the World, will ſoon part with God. The world draws Men from God at Pleaſure; becauſe it doth engroſs your beſt <hi>Time, Thoughts, Affections</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> in its ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. How many profeſſors, by being bewitched with love to the World, have loſt many hopeful bloſſomes and beginnings of love to God? How little do Spiritual Suavities ſavour with Carnal Hearts? Yea, do not the Fleſh-pleaſing ſweets of this World make all the Delices of Heaven ſeem bitter to a Senſual Worldling? What makes the heart poorer, as to things Divine, than the love of worldly Riches? How is the Honour of Chriſt and Religion degraded in that heart, which affects worldly Honours? what more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſtains the Glory of a Chriſtian Profeſſion, than an ambitious affectation of Mundane Glory? Where is that profeſſor, who has his heart engaged in the world without being defiled by it, if not drowned in it? The world is filled with ſuch a contagious air, as that our love is ſoon poyſoned and infected by it. Love to the world is the Devil's Throne, where he lords it; the Helm of the Ship, where he ſits and ſteers the Soul Helwards. This was the bitter root of Lot's wife her Apoſtaſie from God. So <hi>Gen.</hi> 19.26. <hi>But his wife looked back from behind him.</hi> She had left her heart in Sodom; and thence ſhe looks back after it, contrary to God's Command, <hi>v.</hi> 17. And what was the Iſſue of her Apoſtaſie? <hi>She became a pillar of Salt. i. e.</hi> She partaked of Sodom's Plague, which was brimſtone and and ſalt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.23. the ſtorm which fell on Sodom overtook her, and turned her into a Pillar <hi>of Salt,</hi> as a ſtanding Monument of God's Juſtice on Apoſtates, who love the world more than God. Whence ſaith our Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 17.32. <hi>Remember Lot's wife.</hi> What made <hi>Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas</hi> Apoſtatize, but love to the world? As man at firſt fell from God, by loving the world more than God: ſo he is more and more engaged in this Apoſtaſie by love to the world.</p>
            <p n="10">(10) <hi>Love to the world transforms a man into the ſpirit and humour of the world, which is inconſiſtent with the love of God.</hi> Love makes us like to, and ſo one with what we love. For all love aims at <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> and if it Comes ſhort thereof, yet it leaves <hi>Similitude</hi> which is imperfect <hi>

            <p n="11">(11). <hi>Yea Love to the world transforms a Man into a Beaſt, and ſo makes him altogether incapable of Love to God.</hi> So Pſal. 49.20. <hi>Man that is in honour, and vnderſtandeth not, is like the Beaſts that periſh.</hi> This verſe is an <hi>Epiphonema</hi> to the Pſalm, with which he concludes, that a man, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo great in the world, yet, if his heart cleave unto it, he is no better than a Beaſt; albeit he be a man by Nature, yet he is a <hi>Beaſt</hi> by <hi>Affection</hi> and <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration</hi> Yea, what ſhall I ſay? Love to the world transforms a man into worſe than a Beaſt. For <hi>it is better to be a Beaſt, than like to a Beaſt.</hi> As love to God, the Beſt Good, makes us better than the beſt on other men; ſo Love to the world, which is the worſt evil, makes men worſe than the worſt of Beaſts.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:95740:44"/> Love to the world is <hi>extatick,</hi> as well as love to God: and the more the heart cleaves to the the world, the leſs power has it to return to God, or it ſelf.</p>

The Love of God is pure and unſpotted, But O! how filthy and polluted is love to the World? What more cordial and ſincere than love to God? But alas! how artificial, painted and hypocritick is love to this deceitful world? O! how judicious, wiſe and diſcreet, is love to God? what abundance of ſolid, deep, and ſpiritual reaſon has it in its bowels? But oh! what a brutiſh, ſottiſh paſſion is love to the world? How fooliſh are all its luſts? 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9. What a generous and noble Affection is love to God? But what more ſordid and baſe than love to this vile world? Love to God is Regular and Uniform: But O! what Irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rities and Confuſions attend love to the World? How Maſculine, puiſſant and potent, is love to God?

It deſerves not the name of Love but Luſt: Worldly-minded men have a world of Luſts; but what have they to fill them, ſave a bag of empty wind, and vexatious vanities? Love to God is moſt temperate, natural, and ſo beautiful: But ah! what preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, exceſſive, and prodigious heats are there in Love to the World? How is the Mind clarified and brightned by Love to God? But oh! how is it bemiſted, and darkened by Love to the World? Divine love is the Beſt Philoſopher, and maſter of Wiſdome. The love of God amplifies and widens the Heart: But the Love of the world doth confine and narrow it. By Love to God we become Lords over all things beneath our ſelves: But love to the world brings us into ſubjection to the moſt baſe of perſons and things. Worldly minded men can neither obey nor command their Luſts: they cannot obey
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:95740:44"/> them, becauſe they are infinite, and oft contrary: they cannot command them by reaſon of their own feebleneſs. Love to God is tranquil, and ſerene: but love to the world, tempeſtuous and turbulent. Love to God gives re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe and quiet to the ſoul: but love to the world fills it with perpetual agitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inquietude, and reſtleſs motions, without end. Worldly love is a <hi>laeſive paſſion,</hi> but Divine love <hi>perfective</hi> of him that loves. In ſum, love to God is of the ſame nature with God, and therefore the moſt expreſs Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Image of God; the firſt-born of Faith, the ſoul of other graces; the Rule of our actions, a ſummary of the Law; an Angelick life; a prelibation of Heaven; a lively mark of a child of God: for we may read God's Love to us in our love to him. But O! how oppoſite and black are the characters of Love to the world? nothing deſerves the name of Love, but that to God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Hence alſo infer, <hi>that Love to God, and Love to the world, divide all mankind.</hi> There is no middle ſtate between theſe two oppoſites; neither can they ever conſiſt together in their perfect degrees. If thou art a lover of the world, in <hi>John's</hi> ſenſe, thou art a hater of God: and if thou loveſt God thou art an hater of the world. Hereby then thou mayeſt make a judgment of thy ſtate, whether thou art a Saint or a ſinner; a Godly, or worldly man. And remember this, <hi>that to love any worldly good more than God, is in the Scripture's ſenſe, to hate God, Mat.</hi> 6.24.</p>
               <p n="3">3. This alſo inſtructs us, <hi>that all natural irregenerate mens Love, is but concupiſcence or Luſt.</hi> Do not all men in their natural ſtate prefer the creature before the Creator? are not the pleaſures, profits, and Honours of this world, the worldly man's <hi>Trinity,</hi> which he adoreth, and ſacrificeth unto? Have not all men by nature a violent impetuous bent of heart towards ſome one or other worldly Idol? are not their ſouls bound up in ſomething below God? Do not all men naturally eſteem, love, uſe, and enjoy the creature for it ſelf, without referring it to God? and what is this but Luſt?</p>
               <p n="4">4. We are hence likewiſe taught, <hi>that a regular and ordinate love to, and uſe of this world's goods, is very difficult and rare;</hi> Alas! how ſoon doth our love to creatures grow inordinate, either as to its <hi>Subſtance, Quantity, Quality,</hi> or <hi>Mode?</hi> yea, how oft, and how ſoon doth our love to things <hi>lawful</hi> grow ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular and <hi>unlawful?</hi> what an <hi>exceſs</hi> are moſt men guilty of in their love to, and uſe of things <hi>indifferent?</hi> how few are there, <hi>who in uſing this world do not abuſe it,</hi> as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.31? where is that perſon that can ſay with <hi>Paul, Phil.</hi> 4.12. <hi>Every where, and in all things I am inſtructed both to abound and ſuffer want?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. This alſo informs us, <hi>that where predominant Love to the world is noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, viſible, and manifeſt, we cannot, by any rule of judicious Charity, count ſuch a Godly man.</hi> It was a Canon, common among the Jews, mentioned by Rabbi <hi>Salome,</hi> that<note n="(x)" place="margin">Populus terrae non vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catur <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>Haſid.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>the people of the earth are not called Godly, i. e. the Lovers of the world may not be called Saints.</hi> And, Oh! how many worldly profeſſors are cut off from the number of <hi>viſible Saints,</hi> hereby? It is to me a diſmal contemplation, to conſider, how many follow Chriſt in profeſſion, and yet have the black mark of worldlings on there foreheads. O! how much love to the world lies hid under the mask and vizard of profeſſed love
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:95740:45"/> to God? It is not the having or poſſeſſing of the world's goods, but the over-loving of them, that beſpeaks you worldlings. It's true, a Saint may fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der many preternatural heats, yea fevers of Love to the world; yet in time love to God, as a ſttonger fire, expels ſuch violent heats, and noxious hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Hence in like manner we may collect, <hi>That worldly minded profeſſors are compoſed of a world of Contradictions and Inconſiſtences.</hi> Such Love God in profeſſion, but hate him in truth and Affection: Their tongues are tipt with <hi>Heaven,</hi> but their hearts are drencht in the <hi>Earth:</hi> They <hi>pretend</hi> to ſerve God, but they <hi>intend</hi> nothing, but to ſerve their Luſts: They make a ſhew of confidence in God, but place their real confidence in the world. They make mention of God in Name, but exalt the world in Heart: They Conform to the Laws of God in outward ſhew, but Conform to, yea are transformed into the world in Spirit: Finally, they hate ſin and love God in appearance; but they hate God and love ſin in reality, <hi>Ezech.</hi> 33.31.</p>
               <p n="7">7. This alſo inſtructs thus, That for profeſſors of love to God to be deeply engaged in the love of this world is a ſin of deep Aggravation. O! what a peculiar Malignity is there in this ſin? How much <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> do ſuch ſin againſt? What a reproach and diſparagement is caſt on God hereby? Are not profane worldlings juſtified in their earthly-mindedneſs by the worldly love of Profeſſors? Yea, do they not hereby take occaſion to blaſpheme the holy Name of God? Lo! ſay they, theſe are your profeſſors, who are as covetous, as over-reaching in their dealings, as much buried in the Earth, as any other. And is not God hereby greatly diſhonoured? Do not ſuch worldly profeſſors live below their principles, profeſſion, convictions, covenant-Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the practice of former Profeſſors?</p>
               <p n="8">8. This gives us the genuine <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Cauſe, Why the word of God, and all the good things contained therein, find ſo little room in the Hearts of many great Profeſſors.</hi> It is to me a prodigious thing to conſider, among the croud of notional Profeſſors, and Hearers of God's Word, how few entertain the ſame in an honeſt heart. And where lies the main bitter root of this curſed Infidelity, but in love to the world? So <hi>Mark</hi> 4.18, 19. <hi>And theſe are they, which are ſown among thorns: Such as hear the Word; and the cares of this world, and the Deceitfulneſs of Riches, and the Luſts of other things entring in, choke the word and it becometh unfruitful.</hi> It deſerves a particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that the Thorny-ground hearers here characteriſed are ranked in the higheſt form of notional Hearers, as much ſurpaſſing the Highway-ground, or <hi>Stony-ground</hi> Hearers: For in theſe thorny-ground Hearers the word takes ſome root, yea with ſome depth; and ſo ſprings up into a blade, and green ears; and ſo endures a cold winter, yea a ſcorching ſummer's heat: and yet after all it is choaked. How ſo? why, <hi>by the cares of this world.</hi>

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:95740:45"/> ſouls.</hi> That predominant Love to the world, in its proper notion, includes the hatred of God, is evident, from the whole of our diſcourſe: That it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies alſo hatred of our ſelves, is manifeſt, becauſe the hatred of God includes love to death, and ſo by Conſequence the hatred of our own ſouls, as Prov. 8.36. <hi>All they that hate me, Love death, i. e.</hi> in its Cauſes. Oh! how curſed are ſuch as cry up the world, and cry down Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="10">10. Laſtly, this Caſe, as before ſtated, <hi>is a good Key to open ſome dark and hard ſayings in Scripture:</hi> As that, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.24. <hi>It is eaſier for a camel to go thorow an eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi> Which is a proverbial ſpeech, denoting how difficult a thing it is for any rich man, but how impoſſible it is for him that has a predominant love to his riches, and ſo confidence in them, to enter into the Kingdom of God, as <hi>Mark</hi> 10.24.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. This Caſe, as before ſtated, ſerves for the <hi>Conviction</hi> and <hi>Condemnation</hi> of ſuch, who profeſs love to God, and yet love the world more than God. Our Apoſtle ſaith <hi>Love not the world:</hi> and yet what do theſe love but the world? where is the Love which theſe owe to God? And what hopes can ſuch have of God's Love to them? Alas! how poor and narrow is the love of moſt Profeſſors to God? If they have ſome good liking to him, yet how far ſhort do they come of fervent love to him? perhaps their Light and Profeſſion is broad; but O! how narrow is their Love to Chriſt? And do not ſuch as want love for Chriſt fall under the moſt dreadful curſe that ever was, even an <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. which was the formule of the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Excommunication among the Jews, mentioned in <hi>Enoch's</hi> propheſie, <hi>Jud.</hi> 14. and imports a binding over to the great day of Judgment at the coming of our Lord. And Oh! how ſoon will Chriſt meet ſuch in a way of Judgment, who will not now meet him in a way of love? Alas! what an hungry paradiſe have they whoſe love feeds not on Chriſt but the things of time? Is there not a ſting in every creature our love dotes on? O! what abundance of <hi>Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude</hi> and <hi>Injuſtice</hi> lies wrapped up in this Love to the world? Can there be greater ingratitude than this, to ſpend our choiceſt love on love-tokens, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred on us by God to wind up our hearts to the love of himſelf? Is it not alſo the greateſt Injuſtice to give that meaſure of Affection to the creature, which is due to none but the creator?</p>
               <p>Having ſo fair an opportunity I cannot but enter this ſolemn <hi>Proteſtation</hi> againſt all ſuch, as under a Profeſſion of Love to God, concele an adulterous Affection to this world. O! think how ſoon this world will hugg you to death in its arms, if your hearts attend to its bewitching charms. Alas! why ſhould ſick dreams run away with your hearts? What are all thoſe things your hearts luſt after, but the Scum, Froth, Droſs, and Refuſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? Ah, poor fools! why are your hearts ſo much bewitched with the <hi>night-viſions,</hi> whoriſh Idols, or Curſed nothings of time? Remember how dear you pay for your Beloved Idols, how much they are ſalted with the curſe of God.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:95740:46"/>2. Here is matter of doleful <hi>Lamentation,</hi> that in days of ſo much <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of love to God, Men ſhould ſo much abuſe themſelves and the world, by over loving of it. O that painted ſhadows, and dirty clay ſhould run a way with our love! is it not a deplorable caſe, that the golden pleaſures of this Idol world ſhould find ſo much room in our hearts? yea, what matter of humiliation is this, that profeſſors of Love to God ſhould laviſh away ſo much time, ſtudy, care and affection on this periſhing world? Would it not make any ſerious heart to bleed, when it conſiders, how much the profeſſors of this age are conformable to the faſhions, humors, and luſts of this world? O! what an abominable thing is it, that profeſſors ſhould fall down and worſhip this great Idol the world? that the ſons of God ſhould commit folly with this old Whore, which the ſons of men have luſted after ſo many thouſand years? alas! what chains and fetters are there in the world's blandiſhments? what real miſeries? in all her ſeeming felicities? what do all her allurements ſerve for, but to hide Satan's baits? who are they that are moſt in love with the world, but thoſe that leaſt know it? Alas! how little can this world add to, or take from out happineſs? what hath this world to feed our Love, but ſmoak and wind?</p>
               <p n="3">3. Here is alſo a word of <hi>caution</hi> for profeſſors, to take heed how they make Religion and the concerns thereof ſubſervient to worldly intereſt. O! what a curſe and plague is this, to make the higheſt excellence ſubſerve the vileſt luſts? and yet how common is it? I tremble to think how far many profeſſors will be found guilty hereof at the laſt day.</p>
               <p n="4">4. But that which I moſtly deſign as the cloſe of this Diſcourſe, is ſome few words of <hi>Exhortation</hi> and <hi>Direction</hi> unto Chriſtians.</p>
               <p n="1">(1). <hi>To labour after an holy contempt of this dirty ſoul-polluting world.</hi> O! what an <hi>eſſential obligation</hi> do we all lye under, to contemn the <hi>Grandeur</hi> and ſun-burnt glory of this fading world? What is there in this world you can call yours? can you be content to have your Heaven made of ſuch baſe mettal as mire and clay? O what a tranſient thing is all the glory of this periſhing world! conſider the argument which our Apoſtle uſeth in the words follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our text, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.17. <hi>and the world. (i. e.</hi> all the ſplendor, pomp, beauty, pleaſures, and grandeur of the world) <hi>paſſeth away,</hi>

As for you, who are rich in this world, conſider ſeriouſly the exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17, 18, 19. where having cloſed his Epiſtle he has this Divine Inſpiration injected by the Spirit. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this world, that they he not high-minded, nor truſt in uncertain tiches, but in
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:95740:46"/> the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy. That they do good, that they be rich in good works, &amp;c.</hi> There were many rich Merchants at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> where <hi>Timothy</hi> was, who needed this exhortation, as I think many among us.</p>
               <p n="3">(3). Here is a more particular word for <hi>Merchants, Tradeſmen,</hi> and all ſuch as are much engaged in the affairs of this world, That they would take diligent heed that the world do not inſinuate and wind it ſelf into their hearts. O! I beſeech you, keep your hearts far from the walls of this peſt-houſe, this love-polluting world: keep your love in Heaven while your perſons are inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the world. Let not your hearts ſmell of the ſmoke of this lower houſe, but of Heaven: beware that your love do not make its neſt in this world, but let it take wing, and reſt no where ſhort of Heaven, where its Treaſure is. Follow not the guiſes of this ſoul-polluting world: Let this Idol world be nothing to you; but God be all in all. Take heed that the multiplicity of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly affairs choak not the ſenſe of God: remember your beſt riches conſiſt in the poverty of your deſires. Make uſe of proſperity to prepare you for afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: know the deareſt things muſt be parted with when God calls for them; and therefore keep your hearts looſe from them: bring your natural deſires into a narrow compaſs, but let your hearts be enlarged towards God: amuſe not your hearts as children at the gliſtering outſide of things; but fear a ſnare in every comfort: feed much on Spiritual delights, and that will kill carnal pleaſures.</p>
               <p>Let your hearts be as the <hi>Mother-pearl;</hi> which, they ſay, receives no wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but what comes from Heaven: let your hearts be open towards Heaven, but ſhut againſt the world: let not this great Idol enter into God's Temple.</p>
               <p n="4">(4). Laſtly, let us all be exhorted, to be in nothing more curious, than a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the right placing of our Love; that it be fixed on its right <hi>Object,</hi> and in a right <hi>Manner.</hi> Let us get a ſtamp of Grace on all our love, and then it will become Divine. Let us love nothing greatly, but what we ſhall love for ever. It was the ſaying of a ſerious <hi>Janſeniſt: I would never begin to love that, which one day I muſt ceaſe to love.</hi> Let us labour after the higheſt ſtrain of love to God, which is, <hi>to love God for himſelf, and to love our ſelves in God.</hi> Our beſt Being lies in <hi>God,</hi> and therefore our beſt love, is to love our ſelves in <hi>God.</hi> As one extreme heat burns out another; ſo let our love to <hi>God</hi> burn out our love to the World.</p>

            <p>The firſt is the reaſon of his <hi>propounding</hi> this exhortation, that is, becauſe, <hi>he was a worker together with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is the reaſon of their <hi>imbracing</hi> this exhortation, and that is in the 2 verſe, <hi>For he ſaith, I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of Salvation have I ſuccoured thee,</hi> as it is in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8.</p>

            <p>You are here to underſtand by <hi>grace</hi> the <hi>Doctrine of the Goſpel,</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> and fitly in the Scripture called <hi>grace,</hi> as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.2, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Act.</hi> 20.32. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. and in ſundry other Scriptures the doctrine of the Goſpel is called <hi>grace.</hi> And it is called by that name, for theſe three reaſons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is <hi>graciouſly</hi> and out of the free favour of God <hi>beſtowed.</hi> Why it is beſtowed at all, 'tis from <hi>grace:</hi> why it is beſtowed upon one age or place rather than other, 'tis only from <hi>God</hi>'s <hi>free grace</hi> and favour, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.25, 26. It is there ſaid to be a <hi>myſtery kept ſecret ſince the world began, but now made manifeſt.</hi> And that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1. <hi>I ſaid, Behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.</hi> To theſe God was pleaſed by the goſpel to ſay, <hi>Behold me.</hi> He was <hi>found of thoſe that ſought him not.</hi> God<hi>'s</hi> argument to beſtow the goſpel of life upon a perſon, or a family, or a place, is merely from his own free good will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The goſpel is called <hi>grace,</hi> becauſe the ſubject <hi>matter of</hi> the goſpel is <hi>grace.</hi> Whatever it is the goſpel promiſeth, whatever priviledge or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving benefit is contained in the goſpel, is all from grace, we are <hi>juſtified freely by his grace, Rom.</hi> 3.24. <hi>Forgiveneſs of ſin,</hi> it is ſaid to be from <hi>his rich grace, Eph.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Eternal life,</hi> it is the free gift of God. <hi>Effectual vocation,</hi> ſaving converſion is meerly from grace. We are called <hi>according to his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and grace; not according to our works,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. <hi>To you it is given to believe, Phil.</hi> 1.29. God <hi>giveth</hi> repentance, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. <hi>he called me by his grace, Gal.</hi> 3.15. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.7. the Saints are <hi>heirs of grace. Chriſt</hi> himſelf, that obtained all the priviledges of the goſpel for us, was ſent as a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of free grace, free favour, <hi>through the tender mercy of God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk 1.7.8. Joh 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>whereby the day-ſpring from on high hath viſited us. So God loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son.</hi> Chriſt's whole work was to love, and his whole love was free. We purchaſe nothing without leaving of our money behind us. All his ſaved ones have nothing of their own but <hi>impotency</hi> and <hi>antipathy,</hi> nothing of their own to move God to ſave them. The Law diſcovers God's <hi>will,</hi> and the goſpel diſcovers his <hi>good will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The goſpel is called <hi>grace;</hi> becauſe it is the <hi>inſtrument</hi> under the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God of <hi>beſtowing</hi> the benefits of free grace upon us. It is an <hi>invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> to the benefits of free grace: and it is our <hi>warrant</hi> of receiving thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits,
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:95740:48"/> and of applying them. The Goſpel is not only a <hi>ſtory</hi> to tell us what is done, and what is obtained for believers; but it is a <hi>Teſtament</hi> to cauſe and to ſhew unto us our intereſt in them by Faith. We ſhall lay hold upon it, when he who <hi>Ordained</hi> the Goſpel doth <hi>accompany</hi> it. <hi>The Goſpel brings Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> Tit. 2.11. Therefore the Goſpel is called the <hi>Miniſtration of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the Miniſtration of the Spirit.</hi> 2 Cor. 3.8, 9. The Inſtrument made uſe of by the Spirit of God for enabling us to apply the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, and all the benefits of Free Grace contained in it. And ſo I have opened the firſt thing in the Exhortation, and ſhewn vvhat vve are to underſtand by the Grace of God, even the Doctrine of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p n="2"> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>3</label> 2. The ſecond particular in the Exhortation to be opened is, The <hi>receiving</hi> thereof in <hi>vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How is the Doctrine of the Goſpel ſaid to be received in <hi>vain?</hi> In the Greek it is [<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.] The word ſignifies to receive it <hi>emptily,</hi> unfruitfully, unprofitably; and indeed ſo it is too often received. It is true the Goſpel is to be <hi>received,</hi> and it cannot ſave us unleſs it be <hi>received;</hi> and therefore you read ſeveral times in the Scripture of <hi>receiving it, Mat.</hi> 13.23. <hi>The receiving of the ſeed into good ground: Act.</hi> 22.41. <hi>They received the word of God gladly:</hi> And in <hi>Act.</hi> 11.1. <hi>The Gentiles received the word:</hi> And in <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. <hi>They received the word with all chearfulneſs.</hi> So in 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. <hi>They received the word in much affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Goſpel muſt be received, ſo it may be received <hi>unprofitably,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effectually, and in <hi>vain.</hi> And for the opening of this, the Goſpel may be ſaid to be received in vain in two reſpects,</p>
            <p n="1">I. In regard of the <hi>manner</hi> of receiving.</p>
            <p n="2">II. In regard of the <hi>Event,</hi> or the Iſſue of receiving it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, It is received in <hi>vain</hi> in regard of the <hi>manner</hi> of receiving it.</p>
            <p>And that is, When we receive the Goſpel; but not with an <hi>Empty hand.</hi> When the grace of the Goſpel is not ſo received, as to be empty of the the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of our own works and righteouſneſs: This is a vain empty reception; for <hi>the Rich are ſent Empty away.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is received in <hi>vain</hi> when it is not received with the <hi>higheſt Eſtimation</hi> and <hi>Valuation;</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Tim. 1.15.</note> When it is not looked upon to be <hi>worthy of all acceptation</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it; When it is not received as a Pearl, as a Jewel of greateſt price; If <hi>all</hi> be not ſold for it, ſoon will it be left fot <hi>any</hi> thing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When it is not received vvith the greateſt <hi>ardency</hi> of deſire, with hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gring and thirſting after the benefits contained in it. All the inclinations of our ſouls towards all Earthly objects we owe to the benefits of the Goſpel; which if vve purſue not ardently, we ſhall never procure ſuccesfully.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When we do not receive it with a particular <hi>fiducial application</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt upon the warrant of the Infallible Goſpel; but only by a <hi>general aſſent.</hi> When vve receive in into our <hi>Heads</hi> by <hi>Light;</hi> but do not receive it into our <hi>Hearts</hi> by <hi>Faith.</hi> When vve do not <hi>believe with the Heart;</hi> but only <hi>aſſent</hi> vvith the <hi>head.</hi> When we receive it only into our <hi>Ears,</hi> and into our <hi>lips,</hi> and into our <hi>Profeſſions;</hi> but dot receive it as the <hi>good ſeed,</hi> vvhich is to be laid up in the <hi>furrows and the ſoil of the ſoul.</hi> Thus the Goſpel is received in <hi>vain</hi> in regard of the <hi>manner</hi> of receiving it.</p>
            <pb n="89" facs="tcp:95740:48"/>
            <p>Secondly, It is received in vain in regard of the <hi>Iſſue,</hi> the <hi>Event</hi> of receiving it, and that ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When it is not received ſo as to <hi>purifie</hi> the heart, as to kill corruption: when this grace of God doth not teach us effectually to <hi>deny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts:</hi> when men will have an Angelical Goſpel, but will live <hi>Diaboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> lives: when they are not thrown into the mould of the Goſpel, and have not Hearts and practices ſutable to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it doth not <hi>quicken us to new obedience:</hi> when there is a receiving without returning, without any activity for God in holy walking: where there is no <hi>Delight in the Law of God:</hi> when his commandments are <hi>grievous:</hi> when the law doth only <hi>compell,</hi> but the Spirit of the Goſpel doth not <hi>encline</hi> our wills to the <hi>obedience</hi> of the Goſpel: when by the receiving of the Goſpel we are not made a <hi>willing people,</hi> to give up our ſelves to God in the ways of duty: when faith is not made incarnate (as <hi>Luther</hi> ſpeaks) <hi>by maintaining good works,</hi> Tit. 3.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we ſo receive grace, as that it doth not <hi>ſuſtain</hi> us in our troubles, nor bear us up in our ſufferings, when it is not a <hi>word of patience,</hi> as it is call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Thou haſt kept the word of my patience.</hi> The Goſpel duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, as to the Iſſue of its reception, maketh us patient to bear whatever is diſpleaſing and ungrateful unto ſenſe. When we ſee that the <hi>Juſtice of God</hi> is ſatisfied, we can eaſily bear the <hi>injuſtice of men.</hi> When we ſee that God's wrath is appeaſed towards us, we ſhall look upon the wrath of man, yea all outward troubles, to be <hi>cold and feeble.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. When we ſo receive grace as not to <hi>impart</hi> it, and communicate it unto others. If we be <hi>living</hi> we ſhall be <hi>lively</hi> Chriſtians; If we have the <hi>life</hi> of Grace in us, we ſhall <hi>warm</hi> others. If we <hi>do no</hi> good, it is a ſign we have <hi>got no</hi> good. If there be a Spiritual <hi>Life</hi> beſtowed upon us by the Goſpel, there is always a Seminal virtue, an inclination to diſſeminate and to ſcatter Grace a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And laſtly, grace is received in vain as to the Iſſue of our receiving of it; when it is ſo received, as that thereby we do not <hi>obtain ſalvation.</hi> It is the Goſpel of Salvation; but a mere <hi>viſible</hi> owning of the Goſpel ſaveth none. The receiving of it into your <hi>houſes,</hi> into your <hi>heads,</hi> into your <hi>mouths,</hi> brings not any to Heaven. Chriſt will profeſs to thoſe that are empty Profeſſors, and only have externally, and as to the outward priviledges of Grace received the Goſpel, <hi>I never knew you, depart from me,</hi> Mat. 7.23. We are not only to received the priviledges of Grace, but Grace by the priviledge, if we expect Glory.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn what is meant by <hi>the Grace of God,</hi> and whar by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it <hi>in vain.</hi> And this ſhall ſerve for explaining the Exhortation (the firſt part) <hi>Receive not the Grace of God in vain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond part to be opened, is that which contains the reaſons of this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation: <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> and they are theſe two,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt is the reaſon of the Apoſtles giving this Exhortation or caution againſt the receiving of <hi>the Grace of God in vain:</hi> namely, becauſe we are <hi>(ſaith he) workers together.</hi> We read it <hi>workers together with him:</hi> but in the greek 'tis only <hi>workers together,</hi> not <hi>with him.</hi> And there are ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral expoſitions given of this expreſſion <hi>(workers together) Calvin</hi>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:95740:49"/> thinks that this <hi>(working together)</hi> doth intend the working together with the <hi>doctrine</hi> delivered by the Apoſtle: As if the Apoſtle intended, that it was his duty, not only to deliver the <hi>Truths</hi> and the <hi>Doctrines</hi> of the goſpel; but to work together with thoſe Truths and Doctrines, by way of <hi>urging, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting,</hi> or by urging thoſe Doctrines with Exhortations to make them effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and therefore, ſaith he, <hi>Non ſatis eſt docere niſi urgeas:</hi> It is not enough Doctrinally to inform people what is the <hi>Truth;</hi> but we muſt <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rge</hi> it upon them with motives, inducements, and perſwaſions, that may make the Doctrine embraced. And the Syriack ſeems to favour this Expoſition, which renders the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>(working together) promoventes hoc negotium;</hi> as if the work of Doctrinal information were to be promoted by arguments and incitements to the imbracing of the Truth. Others conceive that this <hi>(working together)</hi> is to be referred to the common mutual endeavours of Miniſters, who are to be <hi>fellow-helpers</hi> one with another; as if the Apoſtle had ſaid, All we Miniſters, working together to further our Maſter's work in the converſion and Salvation of your Souls, beſeech you, &amp;c. <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers this <hi>(working together)</hi> to the mutual endeavours of Miniſters and People, as if <hi>Paul</hi> had ſaid, We Apoſtles work together with you, to whom we preach, in this work of your receiving the grace of God, by our exhortations to incite you to comply with the duties propounded in the goſpel. Our <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> interpreters by putting in theſe words <hi>(with him)</hi> underſtand the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle</hi> to intend a working together with God; and indeed Miniſters are called <hi>Labourers with God.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. I ſee no reaſon why we ſhould reject this expoſition, if we take it with theſe two cautions,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, Miniſters in this working with God muſt be looked upon ſo to uſe their abilities, as not implanted in them hy nature, but beſtowed on them by grace, that ſo they may be made apt and fit inſtruments by the grace of God to work. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, 2 <hi>Cor</hi> 3.6. <hi>Who alſo hath made us a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Miniſters of the New Teſtament.</hi> And ſo in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>By the grace of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I am what I am, and I laboured more abundantly than they all; yet not I; but the gace of God which was in me.</hi> His power and abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to work he attributes merely to the grace of God. <hi>And all our ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, If you take this to be the meaning of it, that we are fellow-workers <hi>with God;</hi> you muſt underſtand, that what is the <hi>main</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> in this work, which is the beſtowing of <hi>ſpiritual life and growth,</hi> muſt be lookt upon as only the work <hi>of God,</hi> and to come from him; and that therein man had no ſhare at all, nor is a co-worker with God in it. And as <hi>Beza</hi> well notes on 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. we muſt alwaies obſerve carefully a difference between cauſes <hi>Subordinate,</hi> and cauſes <hi>Co-ordinate.</hi> Miniſters are to be conſidered as purely <hi>in ſubordination to God,</hi> and as thoſe whom God is pleaſed to make uſe of in the way of his <hi>appointment:</hi> not in the way of <hi>effectual concurrence with God,</hi> as if they could communicate any power or ſtrength to the work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Grace by the preaching of the word. <hi>Subordinate</hi> cauſes Miniſters are <hi>to,</hi> not <hi>Co-ordinate</hi> cauſes <hi>with,</hi> God in the great work of producing of our Salvation, which God only hath in his own hand, both as to the <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> working of grace in the Soul, and the <hi>Eternal</hi> beſtowing of glory upon us
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:95740:49"/> in the life to come. There is the firſt reaſon opened; that is, the reaſon why the Apoſtle doth here give them his exhortation, namely, We are <hi>workers to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond is, the reaſon why the Apoſtle doth put them upon this great <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>5</label> duty of not receiving <hi>the Grace of God in vain,</hi> And that is taken from that text in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. where there is this promiſe made unto Chriſt, <hi>I have heard thee in a time accepted, and in the day of ſalvation have I ſuccoured thee.</hi> Theſe are the words of the promiſe that God the Father maketh unto <hi>Chriſt</hi> as <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator;</hi> which is, that in his diſcharging of the great work of ſaving his Church God the Father will <hi>anſwer and ſuccour him,</hi> as the Head of the Church, and ſhew it by granting him a <hi>day</hi> and a <hi>time</hi> for the beſtowing of <hi>efficacious</hi> Grace upon his Members, by making the <hi>means of Grace</hi> effectual for their <hi>Salvation;</hi> which time is here called an <hi>accepted time,</hi> and a <hi>Day of Salvation:</hi> becauſe this <hi>time,</hi> and this <hi>day,</hi> is the time, and the day of God's <hi>free favour,</hi> in which he will <hi>ſo accept</hi> of ſinners, as to ſhew his Gracious <hi>good will</hi> unto them in accepting of them to <hi>life,</hi> and in working by his Son Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Salvation</hi> and deliverance for them. Now this is a very forcible Argument and reaſon againſt the receiving of the Grace of <hi>God in vain;</hi> namely, becauſe there was ſuch a rich treaſure and meaſure of <hi>ſaving and efficacious Grace in the time of the Goſpel</hi> to be diſpenſed to the Church; therefore they ſhould labour to have their ſhare in it, and not receive the Goſpel of Grace <hi>vainly and unprofita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,</hi> as they would approve themſelves to be the Members of Chriſt, and thoſe for whom Chriſt hath prayed unto the Father that they might have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Grace beſtowed upon them. And this ſhall ſerve for opening the ſecond part of this text; namely, the reaſon of the Apoſtle's laying down this exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, both in regard of <hi>himſelf,</hi> becauſe he was a <hi>worker with God,</hi> and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> it was becauſe God the Father had made a promiſe to Chriſt the Head of the Church, that Grace ſhould be beſtowed, ſaving effectual Grace; not Grace in <hi>vain,</hi> but Grace bringing <hi>Salvation</hi> ſhould be afforded in an <hi>accepted time,</hi> and in a <hi>day of Salvation</hi> by the Adminiſtration of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The third part (which is that which I intend to inſiſt upon) is the Apoſtle's <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>6</label> 
               <hi>accommodation,</hi> or his <hi>application</hi> of the fore-going reaſon, taken out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. unto the <hi>preſent ſtate and time of the Corinthians,</hi> by giving them this <hi>qui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>kning Counſel;</hi> that ſince the preſent ſeaſon of Grace which they enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>now</hi> was the <hi>accepted time and the day of Salvation</hi> promiſed unto Chriſt for his people, they ſhould therefore <hi>now</hi> regard, and for the <hi>preſent</hi> improve it profitably. The ſum of the Apoſtle's application is this; ſince God hath in the foregoing reaſon aſſigned a certain <hi>time</hi> and <hi>day</hi> for the exhibition and the beſtowment of his Grace, it followeth, that <hi>all</hi> times and <hi>all</hi> days are not fitted for that purpoſe, but only the time <hi>and the day foretold by the Prophet,</hi> in which God would freely accept of ſinners and bring them to Salvation; and therefore <hi>Paul</hi> putteth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> upon the <hi>preſent improvement</hi> of the ſeaſon of Grace, becauſe God had now beſtowed upon them <hi>that accepted time</hi> and the <hi>day of Salvation</hi> foretold in the foregoing reaſon, which they could not neglect without hazarding the loſs of Divine <hi>acceptation,</hi> and their own eternal <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="92" facs="tcp:95740:50"/>
            <p>All that I have further to do is to handle this <hi>third</hi> part, which is the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's accommodation, or application of the former reaſon taken out of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> unto the preſent ſtate of the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> by giving them this <hi>quickning counſel;</hi> namely, to improve this <hi>preſent</hi> ſeaſon of Grace, which the Prophet foretold of old ſhould be beſtowed upon the Church in the days of the Goſpel, <hi>Behold now is the accepted time: Behold now is the day of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> Now this quickning counſel hath two parts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. An <hi>awakening incitement</hi> to improve the <hi>preſent</hi> ſeaſon of Grace. This <hi>awakening incitement</hi> is contained in the repeated note thereof, <hi>Behold, Behold.</hi> The <hi>preſent ſeaſon of</hi> Grace is intended in the repeated note there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Now, now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. A <hi>double Argument</hi> to convince us of the fitneſs and neceſſity of this du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>Now,</hi> for the <hi>preſent,</hi> to improve the ſeaſon of Grace. The <hi>firſt</hi> Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is taken from the <hi>fitneſs</hi> of the ſeaſon for <hi>working</hi> in it, and ſo 'tis called the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>day.</hi> The ſecond Argument is taken from the advantageouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the preſent ſeaſon to the <hi>worker,</hi> and ſo 'tis called the time <hi>accepted</hi> and the day of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now all that I ſhall further doe, ſhall be to handle theſe two Arguments: and in the handling of them I ſhall only endeavour theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To open the <hi>ſence</hi> and meaning of theſe two Arguments.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew the <hi>force and ſtrength</hi> of both theſe Arguments to engage us to improve the <hi>preſent</hi> ſeaſon of Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall explain the ſenſe of theſe firſt two Arguments in their order: and firſt, the ſenſe of the firſt Argument taken from the <hi>fitneſs</hi> of the <hi>ſeaſon for working,</hi> as 'tis called the <hi>time</hi> and the <hi>day.</hi> And herein firſt, I ſhall explain the word <hi>Time,</hi> ſecondly, the word <hi>Day.</hi>

By <hi>[Time]</hi> is not here meant the <hi>flux, ſucceſſion,</hi> or continuation of <hi>Time</hi> by minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years, which we call the <hi>ſpace of</hi> Time; but by <hi>Time</hi> according to the ſignification of the word in the greek, I underſtand the <hi>tempeſtivity,</hi> or opportunity of time: For in the greek 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, which ſignifies ſeaſon or opportunity, a time accommodated and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to employment; in which we may undertake our Heavenly buſineſs with hope of ſucceſs.

It is as the Angel's ſtirring in the water, into which he that ſtepped firſt was heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. It is as the day of a Prince his audience for the anſwering of petitions.

               <pb n="93" facs="tcp:95740:50"/> conſiſting of 24 hours, including alſo the night; and ſo it is taken in Chriſt's Directory for prayer, which we commonly call the <hi>Lord's prayer,</hi> (Directory (I ſay) for I conceive (with learned <hi>Grotius</hi>) Chriſt doth not command <hi>verba recitari,</hi> the words thereof to be <hi>repeated,</hi> but he commands us only to <hi>draw all the matter</hi> of our prayers out of it, <hi>materiam precum hinc promi praecipit:</hi>) wherein when we pray for <hi>our daily bread day by day,</hi> doubtleſs we pray for what is needful for the <hi>night</hi> too as well as the <hi>day;</hi> (for ſleep is the bread of the night.) therefore by <hi>day</hi> there muſt be meant the whole <hi>natural</hi> day, conſiſting of 24 hours. Sometimes the word day is taken for an <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial day</hi> diſtinguiſhed from the night, <hi>Gen.</hi> 41.40. <hi>In the day the drought, and in the night the froſt conſumed me.</hi> Sometimes the word <hi>day</hi> is taken im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>properly and figuratively in the Scriptures; and ſo ſometimes it is taken for an age, and for a year. Sometimes for a fit <hi>occaſion</hi> or <hi>ſeaſon</hi> of doing any thing; as in <hi>John</hi> 9.4. <hi>I muſt do the work of him that ſent me while it is day.</hi> And ſo the ſeaſon of <hi>receiving good,</hi> as well as <hi>doing good,</hi> is called a day; <hi>Luke</hi> 19.41, 42. <hi>If thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things that concern thy peace:</hi> that is, in the ſeaſon, wherein they have been mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted unto thee by me. So here by <hi>day</hi> I underſtand the <hi>fit ſeaſon</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Salvation by improving the means for obtaining thereof. This briefly for the opening of the firſt Argument, which is the fitneſs of the preſent ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of Grace for our working: it is called the <hi>time,</hi> the <hi>day.</hi>
            </p>

            <p n="1">1. Firſt, This time is called <hi>accepted.</hi> The word for <hi>[accepted,]</hi> in the greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in this its compoſition imports a <hi>well-pleaſing:</hi> Yea, <hi>a very much accepted time.</hi> The Hebrew word <hi>Ratſon,</hi> from whence it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, ſignifies the time of free Grace, <hi>free favour,</hi> or <hi>free good will:</hi> it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken out of <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49.8. and the ſeventy Interpreters they render it in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.13. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. a time of <hi>free favour,</hi> free good will; and <hi>Symma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus</hi> renders it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a time of <hi>reconciliation,</hi> that is, a time wherein God will graciouſly accept ſinners out of free Grace to be reconciled unto them. For when time is ſaid here to be <hi>accepted,</hi> and an <hi>accepted time,</hi> 'tis to be underſtood figuratively, as intending the time wherein God will by free Grace <hi>accept</hi> of man, or wherein God is pleaſed out of his free good will to ſhew himſelf <hi>benevolentem hominibus</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> expreſſeth it) gracious and favourable to man, in that way of accepting him through Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſeaſon of Grace is called the <hi>day of Salvation,</hi> further to ſhew the <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>10</label> advantageouſneſs of this ſeaſon unto the improvers thereof. We muſt not take Salvation here ſo largely as for deliverance from <hi>any evil,</hi> or danger, or the preſervation from <hi>any trouble</hi> or diſtreſs; nor muſt we take <hi>Salvation</hi> here ſo <hi>ſtrictly</hi> and narrowly as to import only <hi>eternal Salvation</hi> in Heaven; as it is taken, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Now is your Salvation nearer, than when you believed; and heirs of Salvation, Heb.</hi> 11.14. Nor muſt you take it ſo ſtrictly as to import only the <hi>means of Salvation,</hi> as it doth often in the Scripture, <hi>Act.</hi> 28.28. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation is of the Gentiles:</hi> but <hi>Salvation</hi> in this place comprehends both that happineſs which is perfect and compleat in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and alſo the entrance into
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:95740:51"/> it, and the beginning of it in <hi>this life; fitneſs</hi> for Salvation here, and the <hi>ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of Salvation hereafter; in which ſenſe the Goſpel is called the <hi>Goſpel of Salvation,</hi> in <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>the word of Salvation,</hi> in <hi>Act.</hi> 13.29. and the <hi>Long-ſuffering of God</hi> is to be <hi>accounted Salvation,</hi> in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> by <hi>Salvation</hi> in theſe places being meant a <hi>fitneſs</hi> for Eternal Salvation by receiving the Goſpel and improving the Long-ſuffering of God and the means of Grace, and our being brought to the <hi>full</hi> Fruition of it in Glory. So in this place <hi>the day of Salvation</hi> is that ſeaſon wherein God beſtows an entrance into Salvation here, followed with a full perfection of it hereafter. And ſo I have opened the ſenſe of theſe two arguments, whereby the Apoſtle urgeth us to the preſent improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſeaſon Grace, both as this is a ſeaſon of <hi>fitneſs</hi> for <hi>working,</hi> and ſo called a <hi>Time,</hi> a <hi>Day,</hi> and as 'tis a Seaſon of <hi>advantageouſneſs</hi> to the <hi>worker,</hi> and ſo called an <hi>accepted</hi> time, wherein God accepts of ſinners to be reconciled to them, and a day of <hi>Salvation,</hi> by the improving whereof God will certainly bring his People to the Fruition and the perfect Participation of Life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in Heaven. Now having thus explained and opened the Senſe of theſe two Arguments, I ſhall only in the ſecond place,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Shew you the <hi>force and ſtrength</hi> of them <hi>both</hi> diſtinctly, to engage us to a preſent improvement of the ſeaſon of Grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. And Firſt I ſhall ſhew you the force of the <hi>firſt Argument,</hi> and that is the <hi>fitneſs</hi> of this preſent ſeaſon of Grace for our <hi>working</hi> and employment. It is (ſaith the Apoſtle) 1. The <hi>Time,</hi> 2. The <hi>Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1"> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>11</label> 1. It is the <hi>Time.</hi> I ſhewed you in the explaining, of the ſenſe of the firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument the meaning of the word <hi>Time.</hi> I told you it did clearly import <hi>tempeſtivity, opportunity,</hi> the flower, the cream, the luſtre, the beauty of time. But how doth this conſideration, that the preſent Seaſon of Grace is the time of <hi>opportunity,</hi> urge and inforce the duty of a <hi>preſent improving</hi> of the ſeaſon of Grace? In anſwer whereunto I offer theſe following conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt is this: The time of <hi>opportunity</hi> is that which we may eaſily <hi>let ſlip.</hi> It is <hi>tempus labile,</hi> a time that may eaſily ſlip between our fingers, eſpecially in Spiritual concernments. It is needful therefore <hi>now,</hi> inſtantly, to lay hold upon it. Opportunity is hardly embraced. The learned Phariſees could not <hi>diſcern their</hi> opportunity by diſcerning the ſigns of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as you have it in <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. and the beginning. Nor could the Jews know their opportunity; it was <hi>hidden from their eyes, Luk.</hi> 19.42. <hi>Who is as the wiſe man?</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi> in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.) that is, how rarely is the wiſe man to be found? Where is he to be found? But why ſo? <hi>The wiſe man</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>diſcerneth time and judgment,</hi> that is, he is able to judge when things are to be done; and therefore 'tis rare to find ſuch a wiſe man. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing of opportunity is a wiſdom that God alone muſt teach us, by conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the ſhortneſs of our time, to be ſo wiſe as to improve it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.12. And God concealeth the ſeaſon, the nick, the juncture of time, wherein he will beſtow Grace upon us; becauſe he would have us <hi>always</hi> watchful, and dependent upon him, humble and ſerious in regarding every ſeaſon. It is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to know ſeaſons for <hi>civil</hi> affairs, eaſy to know the ſeaſon of a trade, to
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:95740:51"/> ſow, to reap, to buy, to ſell; But in thoſe affairs that concern our <hi>Souls</hi> it is hard to find out when they are to he performed. Opportunity is ſo very ſhort and ſudden, and men are ſo blinded with avocations, pleaſures, preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices and vain hopes, that ſometimes theſe make the ſeaſon of regarding their Souls appear too <hi>ſoon;</hi> ſometimes they are ſo blinded with fear and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by dangers and difficulties, and ſeeming impoſſibilities, that they think it too <hi>late:</hi> So that indeed between ſinful <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>fear</hi> it is hard to pitch upon the right ſeaſon and nick of time for the ſaving of our Souls. In every buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but eſpecially ſaving buſineſs, the moſt <hi>difficult</hi> part of the work is the due <hi>limiting</hi> of it. In our voyage to Heaven it is hard to ſave our tide: not one of a thouſand, but lets it ſlip.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, <hi>Opportunity</hi> muſt be <hi>preſently</hi> embraced and improved; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the improving of it is a man's <hi>greateſt wiſdom.</hi> They are called wiſe, who ſo <hi>conſider their latter end,</hi> as that they purſue the preſent ſeaſon of duty <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.29. They are the wiſe that <hi>diſcern time and judgment, Eccl.</hi> 8.5. that is, that diſcern the <hi>opportunity</hi> ſo as to have judgment for the embracing of it. Therefore in <hi>Eccl.</hi> 10.2. The <hi>wiſe man's heart is ſaid to be in his right hand,</hi> that is, the wiſdom of his heart teacheth him to diſpatch his affairs ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diciouſly and dextrouſly both for manner and ſeaſon. The want of this wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom diſcerning the ſeaſon maketh a man like unto a beaſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 49.20. It is worſe to <hi>be like</hi> a beaſt than to <hi>be a</hi> beaſt. To be a beaſt is no ſin, and comparatively no puniſhment: But to be <hi>like</hi> a beaſt is both in a high degree. Yea, the very brute Creatures, they are far wiſer than is he that neglects his opportunity of Grace. <hi>The Stork, the Turtle, the Crane, the Swallow obſerve their ſeaſons</hi> of coming into ſeveral Countries, <hi>Jer.</hi> 8.7, 8. They know their <hi>appointed ſeaſon; but my people know not the judgment of the Lord;</hi> not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the courſe, or manner of God's dealings, ſo as to embrace duty and avoid danger. It is called a fool's property to want a <hi>heart,</hi> when he hath a <hi>price,</hi> that is, an opportunity put into his hand to get wiſdom, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.16. And therefore the 5 Virgins even for this piece of folly are called <hi>fooliſh</hi> even to a Proverb; becauſe they were not ſo wiſe as to know their opportunity. And let a man be never ſo prudent for the world, if he knoweth not the ſeaſon of Grace, he is a mere <hi>Scripture-fool,</hi> and will appear ſo to himſelf and others too to all eternity. And when he comes to die he ſhall be compelled to ſay, Never was I wiſe, who was wiſe for every thing, but to ſave my Soul.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Opportunity</hi> urgeth us to the <hi>preſent</hi> improvement of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it <hi>facilitates</hi> and maketh eaſy every action and employment, making a work come off ſweetly, ſmoothly, and with facility. It is as the laying of the knife upon the joynt, when we would divide the bone. It is wind and tide to the Oars of induſtry. It is as when blowing and rowing go together. God in an opportunity offereth to work <hi>with us.</hi> That which is done with another's help is eaſily done; when both parties joyn in the doing of it. Two men lifting at a burthen make the lifting more eaſy. The leſs of opportunity in our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, always the more of difficulty. The top of time is flowr; but the deeper you go, the further you depart from opportunity, there is the more of bran, the more of dregs. 'Twas obſerved by <hi>Seneca</hi> in this very caſe,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:95740:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Non tantum minimum in imo, ſed peſſimum.</hi> There is not only the <hi>Leaſt,</hi> but the <hi>Worſt</hi> in the bottom of opportunity; And the beſt of opportunity is at the top.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Opportunity muſt <hi>preſently</hi> be embraced, becauſe it maketh every action look <hi>beautiful.</hi> It makes all our performances look with a lovely aſpect, and with a grace. God hath made <hi>every thing beautiful in its time, or in his time,</hi> Eccl. 3.11. <hi>Fruit brought forth in Seaſon</hi> is the pleaſanteſt fruit. The wine of grapes gathered in their vintage and Seaſon, how grateful and generous is it to the taſt! but if the grapes be rotten, and hang beyond <hi>their Seaſon,</hi> their liquor loſeth its gratefulneſs and delightfulneſs. <hi>Eſau</hi>'s tears after the ſeaſon of giving the bleſſing was paſt, were nothing worth: They were as the juice of grapes that were rotten. A <hi>word ſpoken in ſeaſon</hi> is a word up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the wheel, it cometh readily and acceptably unto the ear. To ſeek after God and the good of our Souls in the <hi>Seaſon</hi> of Grace, Oh how lovely is it! When Seaſon is gone, our endeavours are unpleaſant to God, as well as unprofi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table unto us,</p>
            <p n="5">5. Opportunity muſt be preſently improved; becauſe we are deeply ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable for every opportunity: Not only for the actions we do are we <hi>countable,</hi> but for the time which he had to do them in. <hi>Jezabel</hi> was plagued for her neglecting <hi>the time of repenting,</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21. <hi>I gave her ſpace of Repentance, and ſhe repented not.</hi> For the neglecting youthful ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons the young man muſt be <hi>brought to judgment, Eccl.</hi> 11.9. If you muſt give an account for every <hi>idle word,</hi> ſurely for every idle Sermon, for every idle Sabbath, for every idle ordinance, I mean under which you have been i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle. If for every idle word you <hi>ſpeak,</hi> much more for every unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon you make the Miniſter <hi>preach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. Opportunity muſt be preſently improved; For the neglecting of oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity <hi>deſtroys the moſt.</hi> All our Salvation dependeth upon Chriſt, as to the <hi>meriting</hi> of it; but it dependeth upon <hi>opportunity</hi> as to the <hi>obtaining</hi> of it. The neglecting of opportunity is the greateſt deſtroyer in the world. It is not ſo much the being <hi>bad,</hi> as the delaying to be <hi>good,</hi> that undoeth the moſt. It was not <hi>riotouſneſs,</hi> but <hi>ſleepineſs,</hi> that excluded the fooliſh Virgins. The miſery of man is therefore <hi>great upon the earth;</hi> becauſe he doth not <hi>underſtand</hi> judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly <hi>his time</hi> required to every purpoſe. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 8.6. It is not <hi>flat denyal,</hi> but fooliſh delayings that ruine Chriſtians. All that the Devil pretends to deſire is your <hi>now,</hi> your preſent opportunity; he will offer God thy <hi>to morrow.</hi> He ſeemeth to be mannerly and modeſt in bringing men to damnation, <hi>Da mihi quod nunc, &amp; Deo futurum,</hi> Let me have but the <hi>preſent time,</hi> and give God all the future. We miſs of Heaven by ſaying to God (as <hi>Felix</hi> did to <hi>Paul) Go thy way for this time, Act.</hi> 24.25. Few <hi>deny,</hi> but moſt <hi>delay</hi> to be ſaved; And hereby <hi>Satan</hi> doth his work both plauſibly and effectually. Delayes put the likelyeſt and the handſomeſt cheat in the world upon a Sinner. <hi>Moſt are damned by delaying to be ſaved.</hi> And becauſe every age hopes to live that which <hi>is to come,</hi> it liveth not that which <hi>is now preſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Opportunity muſt be preſently improved for the Soul, becauſe it is embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by all in <hi>Loweſt</hi> concernments for the body. The Husbandman, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, the Lawyer, the Sea-man, they all mind their opportunity, their ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:95740:52" rendition="simple:additions"/> Yea for the very cutting of Trees we obſerve our times. Yea the fitteſt ſeaſons are imbraced for <hi>ſinful</hi> undertakings: the Thief obſerveth the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the Watch, the ſleepineſs of the inhabitant: the harlot like the Owl fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth abroad in the twilight: yea the Devil makes uſe of the ſhortneſs of his time to encreaſe his rage. And ſhall opportunities for our Salvation be only neglected? what Chriſtians only fools for our Souls? I have read a ſtory in an old Author concerning a devout man, who, after the ſun was ſome hours up, went to the Chamber door of an old Biſhop, and the Biſhop being aſleep in his bed, the good man knocked at his door uſing theſe words, the <hi>Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows are awaked and a chirping, and is it fit for Biſhops to be ſleeping?</hi> and may not I rather ſay, the men of the world, perſons of all employments, and trades, yea the ſons of violence, they imbrace their ſeaſon, they are up be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, and ſhall the people of God, ſhall Profeſſors then be aſleep, when theſe are awake and active?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſeaſon of Grace is called <hi>a day;</hi> and as 'tis here ſo called, it emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently <label type="milestone">

            <p n="1">1. In the regard of the <hi>nature</hi> of the ſeaſon, it is called a day. And this urgeth us to the preſent improving of it: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>day,</hi> and it is <hi>but a day;</hi> and that is but a ſhort time. It is not call'd a <hi>Year,</hi> a <hi>Month.</hi> It doth not laſt long.

Who can reſtore the loſs of a day? <hi>nec curſum ſupprimit, nec revocat, tempus: Time doth nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppreſs it's courſe, nor recall it;</hi> neither doth it ſlack it, nor revoke it. As time <hi>ſtops</hi> not, ſo time <hi>returns</hi> not. If thy Houſe be burnt, or thy <hi>goods</hi> ſtoln, or thy Lands forfeited, Friends can make a ſupply of thoſe loſſes: but if all thy Friends, nay Creatures in Heaven and in Earth, ſhould conſpire to make thee happy, they cannot with all their combined induſtry and united forces reſtore thee to one of thoſe <hi>good</hi> hours in the day of Grace that thou haſt foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhly miſpent. <hi>Eſau</hi> loſt his day and he could not recall it with tears. The knocking of the <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> could not break open the ſhut door of Heaven. When thy ſun is ſet and thy day compleatly ended, thy ſun will never riſe more. I have heard of one that wantonly threw a Jewel into the Sea; and they ſay the Jewel was brought to him in the belly of a fiſh that was ſerved up to his table. I know not how true this is; but who, or what ſhall ever bring back to thee the Jewel of thy loſt day? none ſhall ever bring back this Jewel to thy table, if thou wilt throw it away by wantonneſs and negligence. God will not turn thy glaſs when it is once out. What the fall was to Angels, that is death to man.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a day: and this ſhould put us upon the preſent improving of it; for it is a <hi>clear</hi> day, a lightſome day. <hi>The ſun of Righteouſneſs</hi> is riſen. <hi>The day-ſping from on high hath viſited</hi> our Horizon with the light of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Now a lightſome, a ſun-ſhiny day, is to be regarded, improved, for the preſent. 'Tis a dark day indeed compared with <hi>Heaven;</hi> but it is light compared with the ſhadows of <hi>Judaiſm,</hi> or the fogs of <hi>Popery.</hi> Work, work; work apace, you that have the ſun-ſhine of the Goſpel. I wiſh I could not ſay, <hi>I ſee a Cloud</hi> far bigger than a <hi>man's hand,</hi> and <hi>I hear a noiſe of much rain.</hi> Now you have ſun-ſhine: cock your Hay; ſhock your Corn a pace; wanton not away your Summer, leaſt you beg in Winter. God by giving of you ſo fair a day, ſheweth <hi>not that your Sun will alwaies ſhine: but that now thou ſhouldſt work.</hi> Slumber not away a ſun-ſhiny day in harveſt. The day, and ſuch a day is ſurely intended for working. <hi>Man goeth forth to his work till the evening:</hi> the night is for ſleep, but the day, eſpecially a ſun-ſhiny day, a clear day for working.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a day: and therefore puts us upon the <hi>preſent</hi> improving of it; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is a <hi>waſting day,</hi> a day that paſſeth and runneth apace. We uſually ſay the day is <hi>far ſpent.</hi> The day goeth, whether you ſit ſtill or no: the ſun runs, yea like a Gyant, like a ſtrong man, though thou creepeſt like a cripple. Though the paſſenger ſleeps in the Ship, the Ship carrieth him apace towards his Haven: thou art idle, but time hurrieth thee to the grave. Time is winged: thy hour-glaſs needs no jogging: there is no ſtopping the ſtream of time. It was a notable ſpeech of one once to a perſon that was in a fit of anger; <hi>Sir</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Domine, ſol ad occaſum: the ſun is going down:</hi> this is my caution to every lazy Chriſtian, if the ſun muſt not go down upon your <hi>wrath,</hi> ſurely it muſt much leſs go down upon your <hi>loitering.</hi> If the ſun in the Heavens muſt not go down upon your <hi>Wrath,</hi> the ſun of your <hi>life</hi> ſhould not be ſuffered to go down upon your <hi>Lazineſs. Cum celeritate temporis utendi velocitate certandum eſt,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca: Our ſwiftneſs in work muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:95740:53"/> with the ſwiftneſs of the time in which we work.</hi> Thou doſt not ſee thy time going; but ſhortly thou wilt ſee it gone: like the inſenſible moving hand of a dial, which, though thou doſt not ſee it moving, yet thou ſeeſt it hath moved.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is a day: and therefore puts us upon the preſent improving of it; For it is <hi>poſſible yet,</hi> that in this thy day, thy work may be done, before ſun ſet, if thou beeſt ſpeedy. Deſpair not; for then induſtry will be frozen. The bridge of mercy is not yet drawn: there is yet a poſſibility for thee to get over to a bleſſed eternity.
'Tis bad to ſay <hi>It is too ſoon,</hi> though moſt have ſaid ſo too often: but it is worſe to ſay <hi>It is too late.</hi> I confeſs thy morning was thy golden hour, and had been far the fitteſt for thy employment; but the evening time is better than no time. I dare not write deſpair upon any man's forehead. If God will help us, much work may be done in a little time; but yet God muſt ſtep in with a Miracle almoſt, if thou ſhouldſt run back the miſpent age of 40 or 50 years in an hour or two; ſurely, you muſt fly rather than run.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a <hi>day,</hi> and for ought you know, It may be your <hi>laſt day:</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore improve that <hi>preſent day.</hi> You have no aſſurance of another: from the upper glaſs of the hour-glaſs, thou canſt not be aſſured of one ſand more. Often ſay thou therefore to the day wherein thou <hi>liveſt, art thou my laſt, or may I look for another?</hi> Though thou art young, it may prove thy laſt day: Death taketh us not by <hi>Seniority.</hi> The <hi>new</hi> pitcher may be as eaſily broken as the <hi>old.</hi> And (which is a more ſevere conſideration) the Spirit of God poſſibly may never knock at the door of thy heart again, never ſtrive <hi>in</hi> thee, never ſtrive <hi>with</hi> thee. Death may knock next, and remember, he will eaſily break into thy body, though thy Miniſter could not get into thy Soul. Death never cometh without a <hi>warrant;</hi> yet it often comes without a <hi>warning.</hi> We do not live by <hi>patent,</hi> but we live at <hi>pleaſure.</hi> How knoweſt thou that the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the Miniſtry ſhall ſhine one Sabbath longer? The <hi>meſſage</hi> ſhall alwaies live, but the <hi>meſſenger</hi> is alwaies dying. The clods of the Earth may ſoon ſtop that mouth, that ſo frequently and unfruitfully hath given thee the word of life. He, the light now of his place and of his people, may be blown out by violence as well as burnt out by death. Thou canſt not ſay, but God may ſoon make that ear of thine <hi>deaf,</hi> that now thou <hi>ſtoppeſt:</hi> God may ſoon blind thoſe eyes, which now thou ſhutteſt. It is a <hi>peradventure</hi> whether God will ever give repentance or no. God hath made many promiſes <hi>to</hi> repentance; but he hath made none <hi>of</hi> repentance. If to day thou ſaiſt thou <hi>wilt not,</hi> to morrow thou maiſt ſay thou <hi>canſt</hi> not pray. It is juſt with God, that he who while he liveth forgets <hi>God,</hi> when he dies ſhould forget <hi>himſelf.</hi> I have heard of a profane miſcreant, that being put upon ſpeedy repentance and turning to God, ſcoffingly anſwered; if I do but ſay three words when I come to dye, <hi>(Miſerere mei Domine: Lord have mercy upon me,)</hi> I am ſure to be happy. This miſerable wretch ſhortly after, falling from his horſe, and receiving thereby a deadly wound, had indeed time to ſpeak three words (as the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on informed me,) but thoſe three words were theſe, <hi>Diabolus capiat omnia, Let the Devil take all.</hi> Thou doſt not know what thy laſt words ſhall be: the very motions of thy tongue and of thy heart are all in the hands of that God, whoſe grace thou haſt deſpiſed.</p>

               <pb n="100" facs="tcp:95740:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>7. It is a day: That requireth preſent improvement; becauſe it is follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a <hi>night,</hi> a night that is dark as pitch. <hi>The night cometh wherein no man can work.</hi> (So ſaith our Lord <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.4.) There is neither work nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention in the grave. In the dark thou mayeſt ſee to bewail thy not working in the light; but in the dark there is no working. Sorrow then will not help thee, couldſt thou make hell to ſwim with thy tears. Thy tears are only of worth in <hi>time.</hi> Put not off your working, till the time wherein you muſt leave work. It is perfect madneſs, not to think of beginning to work till the time of working is at an end. <hi>Nemo finitis nundin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſpiritual <hi>manna</hi> of grace is only to be gathered in the ſix days of thy life. The time after this is a time of reſt, wherein there is no more work to be done to procure Salvation. If this be the day of thy death, tomorrow cannot be the day of thy repentance. <hi>It is miſerable to have that to do for lack of time, which is to do for loſs of time.</hi> Thus I have ſhewn you, how we are put upon preſent improving the ſeaſon of Grace, As 'tis here termed a <hi>day</hi> or in reſpect of the <hi>nature</hi> of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>13</label> 2. Secondly, In regard of the <hi>workers</hi> in this day, we are urged from hence to a preſent improving of the ſeaſon of grace.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How little have we wrought in this day of grace? What a pitiful account (and yet an account muſt be given) of this Day can we give unto God, of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Sabbaths, and repetitions of ordinances, and opportunities of life, that we have enjoyed? You have <hi>been</hi> perhaps long in the world and under the means of grace; but can you ſay, you have <hi>lived</hi> long? 'Tis one thing for paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers in a ſhip to <hi>be</hi> a great while toſt in the Sea, and another thing for them to <hi>ſail</hi> a great way. You have been long in the world toſſed up and down with many temptations, and impetuous corruptions, and violent affections; but which of you have ſailed much, or gone forward in your courſe to Heaven with any conſiderable progreſs? Little is to be ſeen in the copies of your lives, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides blots and empty ſpaces. Much paper hath been ſpent with wide lines. Had you not need now towards the end of the ſide to write the cloſer, to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the time,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſeth it? <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. We ſhould redeem our time out of the hands of thoſe that have taken it captive, out of the clutches of thoſe vain employments, that have ſo often taken it captive. Now in all redemptions there is the laying down a price for the party that is redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: But what is that price you are to lay down for your time, when it is to be redeemed? I will tell you, <hi>Id quod perdis pretium eſt,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Auguſtin</hi>) That which you loſe in your worldly employments, in your idle recreations, in your vain viſits, in your exorbitant eatings and drinkings, that time that you take from theſe to give to God and your Souls, that is the price that you lay down for the redeeming of ſeaſons for your Souls. <hi>It is miſerable for our work to be undone for want of time when we are dying, when it is undone for the loſs of time while we are living.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. How great is the <hi>wo</hi> of thoſe, whoſe Day is <hi>done,</hi> and yet their work is not done, but ſtill to do? You have ſeen their end upon Earth; but you have not heard their cries, and their ſelf-bewailings in hell. How many have
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:95740:54"/> been cut off before your eyes, who ceaſed to be, before they began to live? Improve examples leſt you become examples. Your Schooling is cheap, when it is at the coſt of another. Let the laſhes of Divine ſeverity that have fallen upon others, quicken thee in thy Spiritual pace and travelling towards Heaven. Why ſhould God ſtay for you rather than for them? Thou canſt not miſpend thy time at ſo cheap a rate as they did, by whom God hath warned thee. <hi>Hell is not ſo full of Souls, as it is of delayed purpoſes.</hi> What would not loſt Souls give for a <hi>crum</hi> of that time of which now in this world they make Orts? If the foreſight of their tears for neglecting the Day of grace fetched tears from Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.41.42. How great ſhall the feeling be of the Eternal effects of their inexcuſable folly? How Exuberant, but unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſhall be the flood of their own tears for their former ſlothfulneſs, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver enough to be bewailed, becauſe never at all to be repaired? Surely a ſmall loſs could not draw tears from ſo great a Perſon, as the Son of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Many by beginning betimes in the morning of their day have done <hi>more work</hi> than thou a delayer canſt now accompliſh. They ſhould provoke thee to a holy jealouſie. They ſetting forth for Heaven in the morning, have travelled further in that morning, than thou haſt done in that long Summer's day wherein thou haſt been ſlothful. What a ſhame is it that ſome ſhould be green-headed Saints, and thou a gray-headed Sinner? <hi>Julius Caeſar</hi> (as <hi>Sue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius</hi> reports) reading that <hi>Alexander</hi> had conquered the world in his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful age, profeſt his ſhame, that he, who was ſo much older than <hi>Alexander,</hi> ſhould come ſo far behind him in obtaining victorious glory: This fired <hi>Caeſar</hi> with noble Emulation to exceed him. Envy is ever bad; but Emulati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be holy. Envy is a trouble for another's Eminency, but Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is a troubling of our ſelves for not ariving to another's commendable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In this thy day of working, and in thy working, thou art but a <hi>ſlow work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</hi> Thou haſt a great journey, and art a ſlow ſluggiſh paſſenger. Thou haſt a load of Corruption that preſſeth thee down. Thou Saileſt againſt the tide of corrupt nature. Thou haſt an encumbring body of death that will hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thee from doing even what thou art a doing; a long garment that hindreth and hampereth thee, when thou endeavoureſt to be ſpeedieſt in thy courſe for Heaven. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the Spirit, ſo that thou canſt not do the thing that thou wouldſt.</hi> There are many <hi>Thieves</hi> in thy <hi>Candle</hi> of time, which dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waſt it; Sleeping, Eating, Drinking, Viſiting, being viſited, and a great many other worldly avocations, imployments, injoyments, that muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded together vvith thy Soul: Theſe are as ſo many places, at vvhich vve muſt call in, as vve are in our journey; and the diſpatching of every errand in every one of theſe places vvill take us up much time. Hard it is for our hearts to be preſerved from too deep en ingagement in them; the world more frequently bewitching from God, than admoniſhing us of God; too often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving as birdlime to the vvings of our affections to hinder their ſlight Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vvard. And many alſo are the retarding diſcouragements that all the people of God muſt meet vvith all in their courſe to Heaven: As they have the tide of nature againſt them, ſo they have the vvind of oppoſition from men and devils
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:95740:55"/> againſt them. Earlineſs and eagerneſs in the waies of God are the two things principally oppoſed by the <hi>god,</hi> and <hi>men</hi> of this world.
'Tis the galloping paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger at whom the dogs of the town moſt bark, and whom they moſt purſue. All that travel Heavenward have the wind in their faces, though the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their journey's end infinitely more than countervails for the greateſt both induſtry and oppoſition.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>longer</hi> thou delayeſt thy working in this day, the <hi>harder</hi> it will be for thee to begin. Sin is as deceitful to <hi>detain,</hi> as 'tis to <hi>draw.</hi> Every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thou delayeſt to leave it, it tyeth a knot on the cord wherewith it hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth thee, making thereby thy freedom from it the more difficult. Luſt and delay know no meaſure: and delay knows no meaſure, becauſe luſt knows none. The further you go on, the harder it is, and the more unwilling will you be to go back. The deeper the engagement, the more difficult is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat. By delay ſin is the more ſtrengthened, the Devil the more embolden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and God the more provoked. That which in thee to day is Regardleſneſs, tomorrow may be Unwillingneſs, and the next day Obſtinateneſs. <hi>Dum conſuetudini non reſiſtitur ſit neceſſitas:</hi> Cuſtom in ſin will at length turn into neceſſity of ſinning. <hi>Venenata non patiuntur inducias:</hi> Antidotes againſt poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt not be delay'd. The longer a bad Tenant forbears payment of his Rent, the harder it will be for him te get it up. A nail driven into wood is with more difficulty drawn out, when it is driven up to the head, than when with a few blows it is weakly faſtned. The longer the wood lieth ſoaking in the water, with the greater difficulty doth it burn. The longer Satan's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion hath been, the more difficult will his ejection be. Every delay makes thy return to God look more like to an impoſſibility. <hi>Goliah</hi> muſt be ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the forehead, and <hi>Satan</hi> oppoſed betimes. Old age is <hi>aetas indiſcipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabilis,</hi> an indiſciplinable age. <hi>Childhood is the age of Learning.</hi> Old age is the time, wherein men deſire more to teach than be taught.</p>
            <p n="6">6. As to thy working in this day; the <hi>ſooner</hi> thou beginneſt and the faſter thou workeſt in this day of Grace, the <hi>ſweeter will thy ſleep be</hi> in the evening, when thy day is conſummate. After thou vieweſt thy early, and thy earneſt working for God, in the end of thy life, thou wilt have a Sabbath in thy thoughts. None ever repented them, either of early beginnings, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant proceedings in the ways of holineſs. It was an humbling to <hi>Paul,</hi> that Chriſt appeared laſt of all to him 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and that <hi>Andronicus</hi> and <hi>Junia were in Chriſt before him;</hi> that they were his Seniors in the faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.7. How ſweet is it in age to feed upon the comforts of a well ſpent youth and manhood! Never put that off to the laſt, that cannot be done too ſoon. <hi>Early beginnings in Godlineſs make an eaſy death-bed:</hi> And acquaintance with God betimes makes thee the more confident to go to him. God will never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get thee in the end, who remembreſt him in the beginning of thy life. Should you at length look Heavenward, yet how will it grieve you that you did not make a more early beginning? <hi>The better thou art when thou dyeſt, the more it will trouble thee thou wert holy ſo late. Early Holineſs ſpareth abundance of death-bed trouble.</hi> That man, who puts off his repentance to his end, dies at the beſt with little comfort. <hi>Incertus moritur, qui in fine paenitet:</hi> If he ſhould repent at laſt, yet he dies uncertainly, as to future happineſs. He
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:95740:55"/> rarely knows whither he is going. 'Tis comfortable for a man to be able to ſay to God when he dies, as one did, <hi>Paenitentiam egi quando peccare potui: Lord, thou knoweſt, I then repented of Sin, when I had ſtrength and time and ability and opportunities to ſin.</hi> Thus I have ſhewn you the ſtrength and the force of the firſt Argument, whereby the Apoſtle engageth us to a preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of the ſeaſon of Grace; as 'tis, <hi>for its fitneſs for working,</hi> the <hi>Time,</hi> the <hi>Day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Briefly now, in the ſecond place to ſhew you the force of the ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, <label type="milestone">

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>accepted</hi> time; that is, the time of God's free Grace and good will in accepting of ſinners: not ſo much the accepting of <hi>time,</hi> as the accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>ſinners</hi> in ſuch a time. This expreſſion of God's free good-will in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting ſinners in the ſeaſon of Grace doth notably inſtruct us to a preſent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of it; and that eſpecially for theſe two reaſons,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe, it being the <hi>accepted</hi> time, or time of <hi>free-grace</hi> and good will, we muſt for the preſent improve it upon the account of <hi>gratitude</hi> and <hi>inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe, it being the <hi>accepted</hi> time, and the day of God's <hi>free-grace</hi> in accepting of ſinners, we muſt preſently improve it upon the account of <hi>real ſelf-intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Upon the account of <hi>ingenuous gratitude.</hi> The terms upon which recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation is beſtowed are all free; 'tis free not only in reſpect of the <hi>perſons</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom 'tis beſtowed, who are <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>unworthy</hi> and <hi>polluted</hi> and oppoſite to God; but in reſpect of the terms on which it is beſtowed. The terms are free terms. The old friendſhip between God and man was <hi>kept</hi> up by <hi>Doing;</hi> but reſtoring to friendſhip, or reconciliation, is beſtowed in the way of <hi>belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving.</hi> We do not buy the favour of God. 'Tis not afforded <hi>Secundum preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> but <hi>Secundum pactum.</hi> It is not by laying down any valuable conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the meriting and purchaſing of it; but it is in the way of doing that which God <hi>appoints,</hi> and by his free grace is pleaſed to <hi>condeſcend</hi> unto, and that is humble and thankful acceptation. If we buy it, it is with <hi>another's purſe. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> only bought it. We <hi>part with nothing for the favour of God, but what is our bane, if we keep it.</hi> We may keep all, but what will kill and damn us. Nor doth our obedience to God, when we accept of reconciliation with him through <hi>Chriſt,</hi> make our reconciliation <hi>leſs free;</hi> For the pardon of a Traytor may be free, though it be under the condition of future Loyalty. Now then what is more ſuitable to ingenuous gratitude, than to embrace the ſeaſon of God's beſtowing ſo free a favour? Surely, the leaſt we can do is, to accept of that God that accepteth of us, to accept of him that is ſo full of love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and rewards, we having nothing to bring him but <hi>deformity</hi> and <hi>beggery.</hi>
               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:95740:56"/> Not to accept his favour preſently argues the height of proud ingratitude; concerning which God may ſay, have I this for my <hi>good will?</hi> for my free grace? what not ſo much as accept of my favour that ſhall coſt thee nothing? ſurely the leaſt ſpark of holy ingenuity would prompt us to ſay with him in a caſe of infinitely lower concernment, Lord, we <hi>accept it always, with all thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs;</hi> what thou offereſt freely I accept it readily. What beggar doth not accept of a free alms without delay, or diſputation?</p>
            <p n="2">2. As the ſeaſon of Grace is the <hi>accepted</hi> time, or the time of God's <hi>free acceptation</hi> of ſinners, it engageth us to a preſent improvement of this ſeaſon of grace upon the account of <hi>ſelf-intereſt:</hi> for the neglecting of free grace makes the divine vengeance,</p>

            <p n="1">1. Neglecting of free of grace makes vengeance <hi>unavoidable:</hi> If grace be neglected, what <hi>ſhall</hi> ſave you? if grace ſhall not ſave thee, works <hi>cannot</hi> ſave thee. The neglecter of grace concludes himſelf under a <hi>neceſſity</hi> of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation: He rendeth the book of mercy: He throweth away the remedy, the cordial that ſerveth for his reviving. He that accepts not of life and Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation by <hi>free gift,</hi> muſt have it by earning, muſt have it by working; and earn it we cannot. Thou canſt not obtain reconciliation with God upon eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er terms for thy ſelf, than Chriſt obtained it for believers; and what terms were thoſe, but even perfect, and to thee impoſſible obedience? You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not dig: perfect doing is impoſſible: you are loſt, if aſham'd to beg at the door of free grace for the dole of mercy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The neglecting of free grace makes Divine vengeance <hi>inſupportable.</hi> It diſcovereth the malignity of the heart againſt that which by free grace is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed; for if we cannot diſlike the <hi>price,</hi> which is to bring <hi>neither money nor price,</hi> you muſt then diſlike the <hi>wares,</hi> which are Heaven with holineſs. And how great a ſcorn do we then put upon the Lord Jeſus, the purchaſer of free grace? It was Chriſt's payment that made all free to us. Who can excuſe the contempt of ſuch both <hi>love</hi> and <hi>coſt</hi> at once? there is no liquor that ſcalds ſo tormentingly in hell, as the Oil of mercy. <hi>Grace turned into fury is the moſt killing Enemy.</hi> Freeneſs invites all worldly cuſtomers. Who loveth not coſtly things that coſt him nothing? who ſhunneth an intereſt in a thouſand pounds a year to be had for taking up at the Court? and why alone, my Brethren, ſhould <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> want cuſtomers? are there any commodities ſo rich as his? are there any commodities to us ſo cheap as his? Why ſhould they alone be ſlow that go to take the favour and love of God through him? eſpecially conſidering, that they have paid ſo dear for <hi>that which is not bread,</hi> yea for that which is their bane? Free grace tendered and neglected is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation heightned. You cannot have the favour of God by doing: what will you not have it for receiving neither? you will not then have it at all. It is that hell of hells that free grace is deſpiſed, hath been neglected. Thus much for the firſt branch of the ſecond Argument: the ſeaſon of grace is a time of <hi>acceptation,</hi> and therefore in reſpect of <hi>that</hi> advantage it requires our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent improving thereof.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> the day of <hi>Salvation.</hi> But why doth this ſecond branch put us upon the
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:95740:56" rendition="simple:additions"/> preſent improving of the ſeaſon of grace? For anſwer, take theſe conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is a <hi>day of Salvation;</hi> and Salvation is a work that <hi>muſt</hi> be regarded: 'tis a matter of abſolute neceſſity. Other things are may-be s, at the beſt matters of mere <hi>conveniency;</hi> but Salvation is a buſineſs of peremptory and indiſpedſible neceſſity. A fair day is convenient to ride in; but the journey it ſelf being of life and death is abſolutely <hi>neceſſary.</hi> You may be excuſed at the day of judgment for leaving any thing in the world undone beſides the get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of Salvation. You may be excuſed, if you never had time to get the riches or honours of the world, or great endowments, or employments: but what ſhall excuſe you, if you have not looked after Eternal life? Can you ſay we had another imployment <hi>more,</hi> or <hi>as</hi> neceſſary? can you ſay we were taken up about ſomething more needful, more uſeful? no you cannot. Now remember, that which <hi>muſt</hi> be done, ſhould be <hi>moſt</hi> done and <hi>firſt</hi> done. Firſt attend <hi>neceſſaries,</hi> and then look after <hi>circumſtantials, firſt ſeek the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God.</hi> Here 'tis no meaſuring caſt whether you ſhould obtain Salvation: it is a muſt-be, <hi>Tempus perdimus dum aeternitatem non <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>quaerimus: You loſe all that time that is not ſpent in looking after a happy Eternity:</hi> Firſt get <hi>bread</hi> for thy ſtarving Children, and then, if thou haſt time, look after <hi>rattles</hi> for them. <hi>A work of neceſſity muſt not be put off to a time of uncertainty.</hi> If thou de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layeſt, delay in looking after riches and honour, and the vanities of the World; Oh! but <hi>now, now, now</hi> purſue Salvation. It is a <hi>muſt-be,</hi> and if the preſent time be gone, you may be undone for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Salvation is that which imports <hi>reſt</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction.</hi> Salvation, it is the Soul's quietation and eaſe. Heaven is that center of the Soul: you are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver at reſt till you come there. Now the object of reſt is ſpeedily to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. How doth every thing haſten to its reſt, its center? how doth the ſtone with eagerneſs haſten to the Earth, when thrown from the top of an high ſteeple? how ſwiftly doth the fire fly upwards to its reſt, to its center? with what a rapid motion, with what a fierce career, do the Rivers run into the Sea? they are going to their place, the place of waters. Is Heaven thy reſt? is Heaven thy center? why is thy tendency to it ſo ſluggiſh? You owe unto life Eternal all thoſe propenſions and all thoſe inclinations, wherewith all the things of the World are carried to the centers. The ſpeed that the wicked make in getting to Hell, proclaims that Hell is their proper place and center; though not for reſt, but reſtleſſneſs. Shall every thing haſten to reſt, but thy <hi>Soul?</hi> it was the ſpeech of <hi>Naomi</hi> to her Daughter: <hi>my Daughter, ſhall I not ſeek reſt for thee?</hi> Oh that every one would ſay unto his Soul, my Soul, ſhall I not look after reſt for thee in the boſom of God and the eternal fruition of himſelf? the little Infant that cryes for ſleep will riſe up in judgment againſt a ſinner that doth not look after the reſt of his Soul. That little Infant that cryes for ſleep out-goeth thee in wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a day of <hi>Salvation;</hi> and the purſuing of Salvation is <hi>Opus grande, a great</hi> work, a <hi>vaſt</hi> employment: many things are required to accompliſh it, many luſts to be ſubdued, many duties to be diſcharged, many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be reſiſted, many relations to be filled. Now a <hi>great</hi> work muſt be begun <hi>betimes.</hi> If you had but a little to do in the day, you might lie in bed a great while in the morning: but you have a vaſt work to do; and therefore
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:95740:57"/> get up early. Some poor Creatures will riſe up early to waſhing; a pitiful work to the cleanſing of thy Soul: a far greater work ſurely than to waſh clothes. If you had a thouſand Souls, they might all be employed for the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining of Salvation. If every ſinger were a hand, they might all be employed in getting of <hi>Salvation.</hi> He that hath many Children to look after and a ſmall Eſtate, many to feed and cloath, he ſaith, I muſt riſe early and ſit up late. None have ſo much buſineſs as a Chriſtian. <hi>The work of Chriſtianity is never at an end. The art of Religion is never learned.</hi> There is ſtill an <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſtill ſomething remaining to be done. Bleſſed <hi>Paul</hi> thought himſelf far from per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection: I do not look upon my ſelf as having <hi>attained:</hi> the beſt have much more to be done, than they have already done. I have read of a famous Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, who when he had wrought his picture in the beſt and moſt curious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, would never write at the bottom <hi>feci,</hi> but <hi>faciebam, I did it,</hi> not <hi>I have done it;</hi> becauſe he judged he had never wrought any picture ſo well, but he might work it better, and add ſomething more of art to it. A Chriſtian's art is never complete while he liveth in this world, nor ever did a Saint think himſelf a complete Artiſt. How exceeding large are the commands of God! how little is our moſt, and how bad is our beſt, compared with the rule!</p>
            <p n="4">4. This delaying in the purſuit of <hi>Salvation</hi> is a delaying to be freed from the <hi>greateſt evil.</hi> What is that? the wrath of God, guilt, damnation, hell. Delaying to be freed from extreme miſeries is confuted by conſtant experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence: what condemned Malefactor will delay to get free from his chains, from his dungeon, from the ſentence of death? what tormented perſon upon the rack will ſay, I muſt conſider before I accept of eaſe? and when eaſe and riddance from the rack are offered, if inſtantly he will accept thereof, will ſay; <hi>I will conſider of it, I will give anſwer of it hereafter?</hi> if a duſt fly into the eye, thou haſteſt to get it out, and wilt thou not haſt to eaſe thy ſoul? who ever <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberated,</hi> whether he would come out of the fire or no? 'tis more mad to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berate whether thou wilt be ſaved or no, and get out of the ſtate of damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Here is no place for deliberation;
'tis no meaſuring caſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Salvation it is our <hi>Own</hi> concern, it is <hi>Opus proprium,</hi> our <hi>own</hi> buſineſs it is not another's. It may be a ſlothful apprentice will be backward to riſe in the morning, when he is to do his Maſter's buſineſs: but when he ſets up for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is to gather an Eſtate for himſelf, he will go about his buſineſs ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Salvation is a work for your ſelves, the gain thereof is your own gain. Whatever you get here goes into your own purſe. Here if you are <hi>wiſe, you are wiſe for your ſelves, Prov.</hi> 9.12. Oh that we had more true ſelf-love! the common ſelf-love in the world is imployed about our <hi>bodily ſelf,</hi> the ſhell, the ſheath of the true ſelf, which is the body. Few men truly love their true ſelf: 'tis a common proverb, <hi>intereſt will not lye;</hi> yet the Soul that delays Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, his intereſt lyes. He walks contrary to it, and neglects that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all his bleſſedneſs doth conſiſt, make sorts of his own Salvation.</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is a day of Salvation: and Salvation <hi>recompences for</hi> all <hi>earlineſs</hi> and <hi>earneſtneſs.</hi> Salvation maketh amends for all the ſufferings and ſervices of time. How poor, how ſhort and ſlight is our work compared with our wages? If there could be any trouble in Heaven, it would be this, that we
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:95740:57"/> have laboured for it no more and no ſooner upon Earth. Thou haſt no more to live on to Eternity, than what thou layeſt up here. As our obedience is ſmall compared with our rule preſcribed; ſo it is very ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with our recompence <hi>promiſed.</hi> Though nothing can recompence for the neglect of Salvation; yet Salvation can recompence for the neglecting of all other things. Nor only doth it recompence for our neglecting of all <hi>things,</hi> but for our being neglected of all <hi>perſons,</hi> and for all our reproaches for our early purſuing it: all which will eaſily be confuted with this anſwer, 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be reproached and derided for being <hi>too ſpeedy,</hi> than damned for being <hi>too ſlow</hi> in entring into Heaven's way: 'tis more eaſy to bear the ſcorns of the World, than the ſcourges of Conſcience. I conclude, We can never regard Salvation too ſoon; for we can never either injoy it, or think we can enjoy it too long.</p>

            <p n="1">1. The judgment denounced is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Great deſolation, as to their outward ſtate; verſe 10. and former part of the 11. v.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Utter deſtruction, final ruine; v. 11. <hi>He that made them will not have mercy on them.</hi>

Partly of kindneſs formerly received from him: <hi>He that made them, He that formed them, i. e.</hi> He that created them, gave them their being, (if we underſtand it of the Enemies of God's People.) or he that not only made them as his Creatures, but formed them to be his Servants, formed them into a ſtate, and into a Church, (if we underſtand the words as ſpoken of God's People themſelves.) and ſo had given them their being, not only a natural one, but a civil and Eccleſiaſtical one: he that had formerly done ſo much for them, vouchſafed them ſuch choice mercies, yet now would renounce all kindneſs to them, <hi>have no mercy on them, ſhew them no favour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The cauſe of the judgment to be inflicted: it is a People of no under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it is not a People of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding;</hi> as much
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:95740:58"/> as to ſay, It is not a people of any underſtanding, or as we read it, <hi>It is a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of no underſtanding;</hi> It is a ſottiſh, ignorant people, ſuch as take no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any thing, know not God, obſerve not his works, underſtand not their duty. Other ſins, no doubt, they were chargeable with; but the Lord takes notice eſpecially of their ignorance, and it is for <hi>that</hi> they are here threatned. Hence we take notice, that,</p>
            <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>Ignorance of God, his truths or ways is no ſecurity againſt his judgments.</hi> Jer. 10.25. <hi>Pour out thy fury upon the Heathen that know thee not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Obſ. 2. <hi>The knowledge of the will and ways of God is neceſſary for them, that expect to find favour with God.</hi> They that deſire God would ſave them, muſt labour to know him. That ſome knowledge of the will of God is needful to all thoſe that expect to be ſaved, (for we ſet aſide the caſe of Infants.) I ſuppoſe is clear in it ſelf. But when you hear this Doctrine, you may be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ask, What is that knowledge, which they who would be ſaved ſhould ſeek after? And when that is anſwered, you may again enquire, What means you are to uſe for the obtaining of it. And ſo the caſe to be ſpoken to is this, <hi>What Spiritual knowledge, or knowledge of the things of God,</hi> (for other knowledge at preſent we take no notice of, however commendable in it ſelf, or ſecondarily uſeful to higher ends.) <hi>they ought to ſeek for, who deſire to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; and how ſuch knowledge may be attained.</hi> Of this Caſe<note place="margin">Caſe.</note> there be two parts. I ſhall ſpeak diſtinctly to each: and ſo firſt ſhew, what is that know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge we are to ſeek after; and then give directions for the attaining of it.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What knowledge they are to labour after, who expect to be ſaved. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to which I muſt promiſe ſomething by way of diſtinction, ſomething by way of Conceſſion, and then add other things by way of propoſition for the fuller determining the caſe in hand.</p>
            <p>Diſtinct. 1. <hi>We muſt diſtinguiſh between that knowledge which is ſimply and abſolutely neceſſary to the Salvation of all men, ſo that no man can be ſaved with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it,</hi> but whoſoever falls ſhort of it muſt certainly periſh for lack of it; ſuch knowledge the want of which is always actually damning, and that even in them that have not the means of obtaining it, as Heathens who have no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed light; for in them it is the occaſion of their periſhing: as a man's not knowing the only Medicine in the World that could cure him when ſick, would be the occaſion of his death, and ſo would be his undoing, though not his fault.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And that knowledge, which though it be not ſimply neceſſary to Salvation, <hi>neceſſitate medii,</hi> yet is <hi>Secondarily neceſſary to be in thoſe that would be Saved, or neceſſary in ſome reſpects, and upon ſome ſuppoſitions,</hi> as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. On the account of the circumſtances wherein men are, and the capacity they are in for the gaining of knowledge, whereby they are brought under the obligation of a command to labour after it, and ſo they have the neceſſity of Duty to ſeek that knowledge, though that knowledge it ſelf have not the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of a Mean.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Neceſſary, though not abſolutely to the very <hi>Eſſe</hi> or <hi>Being</hi> of a Chriſtian,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:95740:59"/> and his Salvation, yet to his <hi>bene eſſe,</hi> his <hi>well being,</hi> as a Chriſtian, his bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and more comfortable management of the affairs of his Salvation. The want of this knowledge, if it be not alwaies actually damning, as when God gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth men repentance; yet proceeding in thoſe that are in condition to obtain it not from want of means or capacity, but from groſs negligence, or contempt of the truth, it muſt needs be in it ſelf damnable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By way of Conceſſion. <hi>It is a difficult thing to determine juſt how much knowledge is abſolutely neceſſary to Salvation,</hi> to define the <hi>Minimum quod ſic</hi> (ſo to ſpeak) of Divine knowledge, ſo as to ſay that whoever falls one degree ſhort of it cannot be ſaved. That there be certain prime fundamental Doctrines of Religion, which are ſo neceſſary to Salvation, that men cannot in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary way be ſaved without the knowledge of them, is, I think, confeſſed by the generality of thoſe that pretend to Chriſtian Religion, or to any hopes of Salvation: But which in particular thoſe fundamentals are, and how many, is not alike clear. A controverſie it is, which I ſhall not need to touch upon, not only as being a tender point, but as not being concerned in my preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, as will further appear in the following Propoſitions: It will little avail us in our preſent circumſtances, amidſt ſuch plentiful means of knowledge, and ſo much truth as is revealed to us, to know juſt how much knowledge is abſolutely needful to Salvation; as ſuppoſe, how much would have been ſufficient for the Salvation of a believing Jew before our Saviour's coming in the fleſh, or what knowledge might be ſufficient for the Salvation of, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with truth of Grace in, ſome poor Chriſtian in the darker corners of the Earth, as among the Indians, or Abyſſines. But our buſineſs is to ſee what knowledge we our ſelves, conſidering our condition, (diſmiſſing others in differing circumſtances) are to labour after in obedience to God's command, and for our more holy and comfortable walking with God, and carrying on the affairs of our Salvation. And therefore though my text lead me directly enough to the former, yet I ſhall confine my ſelf to the latter, making it my buſineſs rather to preſs men to labour after much knowledge, than trouble my ſelf or others with unedifying diſtinctions about, or uncertain catalogues of fundamentals, or truths abſolutely needful to be known; which I ſuppoſe few in the World be ſo Magiſterial as Peremptorily to define. And for my part, if I could certainly determine which thoſe truths are, I ſhould take heed to whom I told them, leaſt I ſhould encourage men, ſlothful enough of themſelves, to reſt ſatisfied in a leſſer meaſure of Spiritual knowledg, when a greater might be gotten.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe things premiſed, I come to anſwer the caſe in ſome propoſitions; of which the firſt ſhall be this,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 1. That ſuppoſing it were certainly defined, how much knowledge, and the knowledge of what truths, were ſufficient to Salvation; Yet <hi>no man, that is in a capacity of getting more knowledge, ought to acquieſce in juſt ſo much.</hi> Luk. 12.48. <hi>To whomſoever much is given, of him ſhall much be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</hi> For the more full underſtanding of this propoſition, take theſe follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rules.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">Rule.</note>1. <hi>By how much the better means men have for the getting of knowledge, ſo much the more they ought to know.</hi> There is more knowledge required in them
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:95740:59"/> that have more means, than in them that have leſs. Every ſervant's improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be according to his talent; and the gain of one is not ſufficient for him that hath received five, nor the gain of five for him that hath received ten. According to the means men have, ſo their duty is to be judged of, and their accounts will be expected. I ſuppoſe it can ſcarce be doubted but that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They that live under the Goſpel ſince Chriſt's coming in the fleſh, ought to abound more in Spiritual knowledge, than they that lived before his coming, and that for this very reaſon, becauſe the means of knowledge have been greater ſince his coming, than before it, not only as to the extenſiveneſs of them in the publication of the truth in thoſe places, where it was not heard before, but as to the efficacy of the means themſelves, and the more clear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of the will of God in ſome things, which were formerly, but leſs clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, revealed. The pouring out of the Spirit was not only for the further ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the truth, but for the more plain and full manifeſtation of it. The great myſteries of Religion, which under the Old Teſtament diſpenſation were more obſcure, (as being wrapt up in types and figures, which were, though a ſhadowing of them out, yet a kind of covering to them) are now under the Goſpel more clearly ſet forth without thoſe veils in their native luſtre and brightneſs. What was then future, is now come to paſs; What then was Prophecy, is now become Hiſtory: So that there being, as to the means, more advantages for our knowledge, than there was for theirs who lived in thoſe ages, we are engaged to labour after more. And excepting Prophecies and immediate Revelations, I ſee no reaſon, why vulgar Saints may not now know more than Patriarchs did then; And if they may, I dare ſay they ſhould.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They that live in the Reformed World in this age of Light, ſhould a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound more in knowledge, than they that lived before the Reformation in the darkneſs of Popery. A little knowledge might have gone further then, than a great deal more now: The means of knowledge are now much greater, than 3 or 4 hundred years ago they were. There is not only more humane learning abroad in the World, than then there was; but the Original Languages in which the Scriptures were written, are better known. The Word is more ſoundly and powerfully preached, Controverſies in Religion are more through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcuſſed, more good books are written, more caſes ſtated, more errors detected, and in a word, many truths, (which though always to be found in Scripture, yet were almoſt loſt in the World in the Ignorance of thoſe ages) are anew diſcovered.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They who live under better means of Inſtruction now, ſhould ordinarily be more knowing than ſuch as have not the like means. They that have the word preached to them more plainly, powerfully, frequently, ſhould know more, than they who ſit under an idle ignorant Miniſtry. They that may hear a Sermon every day, if they will, than they that can ſcarce hear one Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in many months. And ſo ſhould they likewiſe, who live in Religious Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, where God is daily worſhipped, Children and Servants daily inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, know more than they who live under profane, or ignorant Maſters or Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents.</p>

Sometimes God calls his Servants more eſpecially to Preach up, and bear Witneſs to ſuch or ſuch a particular Truth, which either
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:95740:62"/> was leſs known and underſtood before, or is more oppoſed at preſent. Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after Chriſt's reſurrection, the great truth of that time, the then <hi>preſent</hi> truth was, that <hi>Jeſus was the Chriſt,</hi> that very <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> whom God had promiſed to the Fathers, and the Jews themſelves did expect. This the Apoſtles did firſt of all Preach, confirming it eſpecially by his Reſurrection from the dead. Thus <hi>Act.</hi> 2.36. <hi>God hath made the ſame Jeſus both Lord and Chriſt, Act.</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted to be a Prince and a Saviour.</hi> So <hi>Philip</hi> to the Eunuch, <hi>Act.</hi> 8.35. And <hi>Paul,</hi> ſo ſoon as he was converted, and ſent to Preach, preſently declares <hi>that Jeſus was the Chriſt, Acts</hi> 9.22. And <hi>Peter</hi> to <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10.42.43. And <hi>Apollos</hi> in <hi>Achaia, ch.</hi> 18.28. And afterwards we find that the Jews, and Judaizing Chriſtians perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly adhering to the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> gave occaſion to the more full Preaching of the Doctrine of <hi>free Grace and Juſtification by Chriſt alone, and the aboliſhing of the legal Ceremonies,</hi> as we may ſee in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans, Galatians, Coloſſians</hi> and <hi>Hebrews.</hi> And after towards the end of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times, the Hereſie of <hi>Cerinthus</hi> gave occaſion to the more full vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting <hi>the Doctrines of Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>Godhead,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hieronym. in Catal. Script. Eccleſiaſt.</note> as we ſee in the Goſpel of <hi>John.</hi> And ſome hundreds of years after that, the <hi>Pelagian</hi> Hereſie gave occaſion for the renewed publication of the Doctrine of <hi>free Grace</hi> by <hi>Auſtin, Proſper</hi> and others. And in the beginning of the reformation of Religion, in the laſt age, the firſt truths God called thoſe Worthies that then lived to the Preaching of, were thoſe eſpecially which concern the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his <hi>Prophetical</hi> and <hi>Prieſtly</hi> offices, ſuch as the Authority, Perfection, &amp;c. of the Scripture, and the <hi>Sufficiency of Chriſt's ſatisfaction and interceſſion.</hi> And to come near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to our ſelves, one great truth which hath been more clearly known and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in our age is, the Doctrine of Chiſt's <hi>Kingly</hi> office and legiſlative power in relation to his Church, in oppoſition to the uſurpations and impoſitions of Men. Now then we ſay, that Men are called at ſuch times eſpecially to ſtudy ſuch truths; becauſe God doth then give them the beſt means and advantages for the knowing of them, or they may then do him beſt ſervice in maintaining them and bearing teſtimony to them, vvhen the Devil and his inſtruments do moſt oppoſe them It is a ſhame for Profeſſors not to ſee, when the World is ſo full of light, not to have the knowledge of thoſe truths in the minds, the talk of which is in every Man's mouth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 5. <hi>Men ſhould labour for ſuch knowledge as may defend them from the errors of the times, and places in which they live.</hi> This I add to ſecond the former Propoſition, from whence it follows. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> labours to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh the Saints, to whom he writes, chiefly the Churches before mentioned, againſt <hi>the then prevailing errors</hi> of thoſe, whether Jews, or falſe Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren among themſelves, vvho endeavoured to bring in the Ceremonial Law upon the Profeſſors of the Goſpel; and therefore bids the <hi>Galatians, ch.</hi> 5.1. <hi>ſtand faſt in their liberty,</hi> &amp;c. Doctrinal error tends to the corruption of worſhip. And the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> in his Epiſtles gives caution againſt thoſe ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing Spirits, and Antichriſts, that vvere even then among the Churches, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. <hi>beginning.</hi> We find by experience, that as there be ſome Doctrines more eſpecially known, and publiſhed in their reſpective times, and ages: ſo likewiſe ſeveral ages (and many times places) have their <hi>peculiar errors,</hi>
               <pb n="117" facs="tcp:95740:62"/> either new ones firſt forged, or old ones new burniſhed. The Devil makes it his buſineſs, and even ſets his wits upon the tenters to furniſh the World with variety of lies, ſuitable to the various humours and Intereſts of Men; and when one error is detected, begins to ſmell rank, and go out of date, through the power and prevalency of the truth, he carefully provides another to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed it; and if a new one be not at hand, as if his invention failed him, he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times conjures up ſome old dead one, and makes it vvalk about in a new dreſs, and paſs for ſome new or newly revived truth, vvhen indeed it is but the Apparition of a long ſince buried error. As Merchants are vvont to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what commodities pleaſe moſt in ſuch and ſuch places, and at ſuch and ſuch times, and accordingly take care to ſupply the markets: So the Devil looks what wares vvill vend beſt in ſuch a Country, at ſuch a ſeaſon, vvhat vvill be moſt grateful to the luſts and intereſts of Men, and then will be ſure to ſupply them with thoſe moſt, which he ſees take moſt. Diſeaſes have their times and ſeaſons, and are then moſt dangerous vvhen they prevail moſt, and ſpread far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſt. Errors have their times and ſeaſons too,<note place="margin">Rev. 3.10.</note> (there is an hour of theſe as well as other temptations) when they are moſt infectious and dangerous; and therefore, as vvhen diſeaſes are epedemical every one almoſt will be taking An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidotes: So vvhen Errors are Epidemical, it is the vviſdom of every Chriſtian to fence himſelf againſt them. And though vve do not ſay, that every private Believer is bound to be a School-divine, to be exact in all the niceties and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies which may ariſe about matters of Religion; (a Man may be ſaved that never read <hi>Aquinas,</hi> nor <hi>Scotus</hi>) yet ſure every one that is capable of it ſhould labour ſo to underſtand the Doctrine of Religion, as to be able to know what is Truth, and what is Error; and to be ſo eſtabliſhed in the belief of the truth, as that, though he cannot anſwer all the Quirks, and Captions of a wrangling Sophiſter, yet he may ſee a reaſon (as before) for vvhat he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and for his firmly adhering to it. As if a ſubtle diſputer ſhould bring an Argument to prove that the Sun is not up at noon day, though a Man were not able preſently to diſcover the fallacy, yet he would not lightly believe a thing ſo contrary to his very ſenſe. It is good (I am ſure) for Chriſtians to be ſo eſtabliſhed againſt reigning errors, as that though an Angel from Heaven ſhould labour to propagate them, yet to be pertinacious, and graciouſly obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate in rejecting them.</p>

It is a vain thing to know what to hold, and not know what to do; to underſtand Controverſie and be Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of Duties. <hi>Ne quaere</hi> (ſaith one) <hi>in ſcientiâ oblectamentum animae, ſed remedium:</hi> We ſhould not Labour to know theſe things merely which may delight our Minds, but ſuch as may heal our Souls; to know our diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and our Medicines, our Wandrings and our Way, our Defects and our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: And not only thoſe things neither which concern us as Chriſtians in the General, but in ſuch Ranks Orders and Relations as God hath ſet us in; and ſo that which is every Man's ſpecial duty, ſhould be every Man's ſpecial ſtudy. As Miniſters ſhould know how to behave themſelves <hi>in the Houſe of God</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. So ſhould Magiſtrates, how they are to behave themſelves in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, Maſters in their Families, Husbands towards their Wives, Wives toward their Husbands, both toward their Children, and they again toward their Parents. In a word, Men are to ſtudy thoſe things which are moſt profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table; ſuch as will better their condition, and not only improve their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. You know a ſick Man had rather have a good Medicine than fine Clothes, he minds more the eaſing of his Pain, than the dreſſing up of his Body; That which will make you ſpruce, will not always make you well; Fine trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings will not Cure a lame Horſe, nor the Painting of the Face heal the Diſeaſes of the Spleen or Liver; That knowledge, which adorns your Mind, yet may not always mend your Heart; To conclude this, Men muſt labour to know the truth as it <hi>is in Jeſus, Eph.</hi> 4.21. So to know it as to feel it, and be under the influence of it; or to know the truth to that end, for which Chriſt teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth it; that is, that Men may be better, as well as wiſer, more ready to do their Maſter's will, as well as know it. Men know the truth as they ſhould, and as Chriſt would have them, when their knowledge puts them upon the great duties of Mortification, and Sanctification; <hi>v.</hi> 22.

               <hi>Prop.</hi> 7. <hi>Every Man ſhould labour to get as much Spiritual knowledge as he can, by the means of the knowledge he hath, and as he can get, without the neglect of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſary duties.</hi> It is not for nothing that the Apoſtle prays for the <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſſians Ch.</hi> 1.9. that they might <hi>be filled with the knowledge of God's will in all Wiſdom and Spiritual underſtanding:</hi> and exhorts the <hi>Corinthians Epiſt.</hi> 1.14.20. though <hi>in Malice</hi> they were <hi>Children,</hi> yet <hi>in underſtanding</hi> to be <hi>Men.</hi> If Chriſtians ought to grow in every Grace, why not in knowledge, which is it ſelf a Grace, and helpful to all other Graces? We are to be accomptable for the means we have of getting our knowledge increaſed, and therefore ſure are to labour that we may get it encreaſed. And though a leſs meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge might ſerve turn to bring a Man to Heaven, yet 1. It is contrary to that Spirit of Ingenuity, that largeneſs of Heart towards the things of God, which
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:95740:63"/> is ſuppoſed to be in Believers, to ſtint themſelves in the knowledge of the truth, and to be content to know only juſt ſo much as may carry them to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That were to ſtudy Spiritual truths, not ſo much becauſe they love them, as becauſe they cannot want them; and ſo not of choice but neceſſity. 2. Even where a leſs meaſure of knowledge might ſave a Man, yet a greater ſhould be endeavoured after; becauſe it might be otherwiſe ſo uſeful: For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It might make his work more eaſie; Clearneſs of knowledge takes off much from the Difficulty of Duty: The better a Man ſees his work, the more eaſily he may do it. The moſt skilful Artiſt may ſumble when he works by a dim light. That Man is like to go on moſt readily in his way, who not only knows the right one, but the wrong ones too, thoſe turnings and by-paths which might miſlead him, and ſeeing the Monuments of others miſtakes may be warned by their wandrings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More knowledge might make his way more pleaſant. The more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectable Objects a Man hath to entertain his Eyes, the more delight he may take in Travelling; When Night-journeys, as they have more of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, ſo have leſs of Pleaſure. A clear ſight of Spiritual things may help a Chriſtian in his way, not only as a Direction, but as a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light.</p>
            <p n="3">3, It might make himſelf more uſeful, more helpful to others.<note place="margin">Nec in hoc tantùm te ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerſo ut pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficias, ſed ut proſis, <hi>Sen. Epiſt.</hi>
               </note> Though leſs knowledge might ſuffice us for our ſelves, as to our general Duties; yet more will make us helpful to others, and enable us better for the performance of relative Duties.

               <hi>Caut.</hi> 1. <hi>Take heed of curioſity,</hi> which is the itch of the mind: It is not a kindly appetite, but a fond longing, or an ambitious vain affectation of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe things which we are leaſt concerned, or not at all concerned to know; and which, if known, would do us little good. It is a luſt, and therefore not to be indulged in our ſelves, but mortified. It appears,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In making inquiries into theſe things which God hath not revealed;</hi> Deut. 29.29. <hi>Secret things belong to the Lord our God; but things that are revealed; unto us and to our Children,</hi> &amp;c. This curioſity our Saviour checks in his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Act.</hi> 1.6. <hi>Wilt thou</hi> (ſay they) <hi>at this time reſtore the Kingdom to Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael?</hi> Our Saviour replies, <hi>It is not for you to know the times and the ſeaſons, which the Father hath put in his own power.</hi> God hath revealed enough to us in his Word for our uſe and furtherance in Faith and Holineſs, and to deſire to know more, is to deſire to be wiſer than God would have us. We muſt not pry into thoſe things which it is only God's Prerogative to know. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels themſelves know not ſome things, and we ſhould be content, as well as they, not to be omniſcient. It is dangerous peeping into God's Ark: you
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:95740:64"/> know who ſmarted for it, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 6.19. If knowing what God hath revealed do not ſave us, I am ſure ſearching into what he hath not revealed, will not. God hath told us ſo much of his mind in the word, as may take up our whole Man in the ſtudy of it; and we cannot buſie our ſelves in inquiring into his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets without neglecting the ſtudy of thoſe things, which are revealed, and are moſt uſeful for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Curioſity appears in <hi>enquiring into the reaſon of God's will.</hi> If Rulers in the World will not have their Laws diſputed: If <hi>volumus &amp; jubemus</hi> be their ſtile, and though they do not give the reaſon of their Commands, yet they count their Commands reaſon enough for their Subjects obedience; Sure we ſhould allow God as much, as we do his Creatures. We ſhould reckon God's will is never unreaſonable. His Commands are as wiſe, as holy; and if he hath not revealed to us the reaſon of his will, it is becauſe he would exerciſe our humility, and have us own his Sovereignty in our obedience, and acknowledge him to be the ſupreme Judge, as well as Author of our duty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſame we may ſay of Mens <hi>enquiring into thoſe things which concern others rather than themſelves:</hi> When Men are Learned in other Mens duties, but ignorant of their own; can ſpy motes in other Mens eyes, and not ſee beams in their own; <hi>Mat.</hi> 7 3. Can criticize upon little faults in their Neighbours, and yet overlook much greater in themſelves.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>We muſt deny our ſelves in our carnal reaſonings,</hi> Subject our underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to the Authority of God, leave ſomething for faith to do, and not think to be ſuch abſolute Maſters of all divine myſteries, as to receive no more of them than our own reaſon can comprehend, when it is the higheſt reaſon in the World to believe what ever God ſpeaks, though our reaſon cannot reach it; Our wiſdom in Spiritual things muſt begin in our being fools in the World's account, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>If any Man among you ſeemeth to be wiſe in this World, let him become a fool that he may be wiſe.</hi> Though we muſt uſe our reaſon in the ſearch of Spiritual truths, yet not reaſon only: many things purely are the objects of our faith, and of them reaſon is no competent judge.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt be diligent in the reading and ſtudying of the Scriptures, as the repoſitory, the fountain of Spiritual knowledge: <hi>Search the Scripture,</hi> ſaith our Saviour Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 5.39. <hi>O how I love thy Law! it is my meditation all the day,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 119.97. <hi>Give attendance to reading,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.13. I have heard of a Cardinal, that either acknowledged or boaſted that he never read the Bible but once in his life. Reading other Books, <hi>Sententia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> and <hi>Canoniſts,</hi> might make him wiſe enough to be a Cardinal, but not wiſe enough to be a Chriſtian. Where ſhould we ſeek for knowledge but in the Fountain of knowledge? how ſhould we better underſtand God's Law, than by <hi>receiving it at his mouth?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. Yet we are not ſo confined to the Scripture alone, as that we may not make uſe of other <hi>good books,</hi> the labours of ſuch faithful ſervants of God as have beſt ſtudied his word, and beſt underſtood his mind. How doth this age and place abound with good and ſound<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and profitable books? and well it were, that it abounded with none elſe; however we have our choice, and that too in our own Tongue. Private Chriſtians need not the learned Languages to make them learned in the Scriptures. Expoſitors we have to help us to underſtand the meaning of the word; Practical writers and caſuiſts to quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our affections, and apply truths to our Conſciences; Controverſial ones to diſcover errors, and arm us againſt them; and Syſtematical, and Cateche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical ones to methodize our knowledge, and order what we know, and ſhew the connexion of Spiritual truths among themſelves, and their dependence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on each other, that ſo we may have a map of the way to Heaven before us, a full proſpect of our whole Religion at one view. And were it not well if ſome would ſpare a little time from their ſhop-books for ſuch books as theſe? if when they cannot be getting money, they would get knowledge? when they cannot be dealing with good Cuſtomers, they would deal with good Authors, ſuch as might make them more wiſe, when not more rich?</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>We ſhould be diligent and regular in attending on the word preached.</hi>
               <pb n="122" facs="tcp:95740:65"/> As it is the duty of Miniſters to be inſtant, and Preach the word <hi>in ſeaſon, and out of ſeaſon,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.2. So it is duty of people to hear it. Reading the Scriptures and good Books is not ſufficient for thoſe that are in a capacity to hear: The Preaching of the Word is the great Ordinance appointed by God, for the Inſtruction, Edification, and Converſion of thoſe that are to be ſaved; and it is that which God doth uſually accompany with moſt life and power. As it is in other caſes, ſo it is for the moſt part here; you are commonly more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with what you hear Men ſpeak, than with what they write. Miniſters may write or print their Sermons, but not their Affections, not that Power and Spirit of the word, which themſelves feel, and you perceive in them. You are moſt like to be warmed by the word, when you hear it coming out of a hot heart. When you ſee your Teachers affected with the truths they deliver, and ſpeaking like thoſe that feel what they ſpeak, you are moſt like to be affected too. Though indeed the great reaſon of hearing is, becauſe it is God's Ordinance, and he hath not only taken care that the word ſhould be written, that ſo all may read it; but hath appointed Officers too purpoſely to Preach it, that ſo all may hear it.</p>
            <p>But withal be ſure to be regular in your hearing. <hi>Take heed how you hear, Luke</hi> 8.18. <hi>and take heed what you hear, Mark</hi> 4.28. and from both will follow, that you muſt take heed who you hear too. Hear thoſe that are moſt knowing, and beſt able to inſtruct you, thoſe that are moſt ſound and leaſt like to miſlead you. Do not chooſe to put your Souls under the conduct of blind-guides. <hi>Seek for the Law at their mouths,</hi> whoſe <hi>lips do beſt preſerve knowledge.</hi> And when you have found ſuch, keep cloſe to them. Settle your ſelves under the guidance of ſome faithful Paſtor, upon whoſe Miniſtry you may ordinarily attend. That running to and from, which is uſual among us, is quite another than what <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>ch.</hi> 12.4. and I am ſure is not the way to <hi>encreaſe knowledge.</hi> Rolling ſtones gather no moſs. Such ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſeldom hit upon the right way. Such wandring Stars may be ſooneſt <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſted.</hi> They that thus run from one Miniſter to another, may ſoon run from one opinion to another, and from one errour to another. I dare ſafely ſay, you may get more ſound knowledge of the things of God by conſtant attendance upon the Miniſtry of one of leſs abilities, than by rambling up and down to hear <hi>many,</hi> though of the greateſt gifts. It is a great advantage to your gaining knowledge to hear a Miniſter's whole diſcourſe, and be able to take up the full deſign of his work, and not merely to hear <hi>in tranſitu,</hi> by ſnatches, to pick up here a notion, and there a notion, or hear one Man's Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine in the Morning, and another's Application in the Afternoon. It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if Men that run to and fro,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.</note> be <hi>toſſed to and fro:</hi> They that are ſo light of hearing may eaſily be <hi>carried about with every wind of Doctrine;</hi> the word of Chriſt ſeldom dwells in ſuch <hi>vagabond</hi> hearers.</p>

He that was his Father's Counſellor in making his Laws, and his Meſſenger in publiſhing them, is beſt able to make us under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand them. As it is our duty to Hear him, ſo it is his buſineſs to inſtruct us: Only beſide the uſe of all other means, we muſt look to him for his teaching. He only can make all means effectual, and none learn as they ſhould, but they that learn of him. There is no learning like that we get upon our knees; that is the only ſaving knowledge, which we fetch from Heaven. If you put your Children to a Trade, you will have them learn it of ſuch as are moſt skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in it. If you would your ſelves underſtand any art well, you ſeek for the beſt Artiſt you can to inſtruct you. Who can teach you all things like him that knows all things? who can enlighten you like him who is the <hi>true light? John</hi> 1.9. Men when they teach their Scholars oftentimes complain of their dulneſs, they can but propound their notions to them, not beget an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding in them. And Miniſters complain of their hearers, as the Apoſtle did of the <hi>Hebrews ch.</hi> 5.11., that <hi>they are dull of hearing.</hi>

If you ſay this concerns your Children, rather than your ſelves, I add, <hi>be much in teaching others the things of God:</hi> that is the way to learn them more fully your ſelves. The communicating your knowledge is the way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe it. You will get more than you give, and while you impart it, you will beſt retain it. While you inſtruct others, God will inſtruct you, and you may come to ſee more in his truths when you teach them others, than ever you did when you learned them firſt your ſelves: not that every profeſſor of the Goſpel is to be a publick Preacher of the Goſpel; Private perſons are not to invade an office to which God never called them: but yet private Chriſtians may be a kind of private teachers, they may read the Scriptures in their houſes,
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:95740:66"/> who yet may not take upon them to explain it in the publick; they may cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chize, and as <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 18.19. teach their <hi>Children and their houſholds to know the way of the Lord,</hi> who yet are not to inſtruct congregations; they may exhort one another and admoniſh one another, and teach one another, in Godly diſcourſe and conference, communicating each others experiences, and ſolving each others doubts, who yet are not to uſurp a work into their hands, for which Chriſt hath appointed a particular Office in his Church.</p>

Ordinarily the more holy you are, the more really wiſe you are, or are like to be. The better your hearts are, the clearer your heads will be, as to the knowledg of thoſe Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things you are moſt concerned to know.

This doctrine <hi>informs</hi> us, 1. <hi>How miſerable they are that are without knowlede,</hi> poor ignorant blind ſinners, that know nothing of God and Chriſt and the myſteries of the Goſpel, and the way of duty: but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they that enjoy the means of knowledg, and are in a capacity of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. Woe be to them that are ignorant in an Age of knowledg, blind in a land of light, ſee ſo little even in <hi>a valley of viſion;</hi> that are ignorant in <hi>England,</hi> ignorant in <hi>London;</hi> that are ignorant becauſe they will be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, are in the dark becauſe they love darkneſs. We may even wonder at many, what ſhift they make to maintain their ignorance, when ſo much know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg is abroad, but that they draw the curtains and cloſe their eyes, and wink away the light, and inſtead of looking for ſaving knowledg, they hope to be excuſed by their ignorance. What though ſuch as are under an invincible ignorance of revealed truths, may not be damned for not believing what they have not heard, or for not doing what they have not known? they are miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable enough in not knowing what might ſave them, as well as in their not practiſing the little they do know, which though it be not ſufficient to make them happy, yet is ſufficient to make them inexcuſable. And what is this to thoſe that are ſo deeply ignorant under the means of knowledge? who is there among us, but might come to know ſo much as is needful to his Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? who is there but might hear good Miniſters, or hath ſome good Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, or might converſe with ſome good people, or read ſome good book? Who is there but hath, or may have a Bible, and a Catechiſm? and ſo long as Men have the Bible in their hands, they can never be excuſed, if they pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:95740:66"/> in their ignorance. So long as Chriſt is the Prophet of his Church, and promiſeth his Spirit to them that ask him, and offereth ſo freely to inſtruct them; the caſe of thoſe that are among, and converſe with God's people, and yet remain ignorant, muſt needs be deſperate. Is it ſo great a matter to hear the word, to read the Scriptures, and to pray to God for an underſtanding of them? who will pity a man that periſheth for thirſt, and yet ſits by a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? or that ſtarves for hunger, and yet may come every day to a full gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary?</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How fooliſh are they that cry down knowledg,</hi> and conſequently <hi>cry up ignorance?</hi> Make that the mother of devotion, which is indeed the Parent of irreligion? as if they were like to do moſt, who know leaſt, as if they were the beſt ſervants, who were leaſt acquainted with their Maſter's will; or might be <hi>wiſe to Salvation</hi> and yet ignorant of the truth. Others there are too, who under the name of <hi>Head-knowledg</hi> do upon the matter cry down all knowledg, at leaſt vvhich themſelves have not reached, and care not for ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after. Becauſe ſome men have only a notional knowledg, floating in their heads, theſe perſons are ready to condemn all knowledg under that notion. They have got a fine word by the end, and are reſolved to make much of it. A form of ſpeech they have taken up, as a way of excuſing their own ſloth and ignorance, by declaiming againſt thoſe that are better taught. <hi>Heart-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg</hi> without <hi>Head-knowledg</hi> is nonſence in divinity as well as reaſon: it is but fire without light, and ſo at the beſt but that which the Apoſtle aſcribes to the Jews, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.2. <hi>A zeal of God, but not according to knowledg.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>How wicked are they? how great is their ſin, that keep others from know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg?</hi> Some there be that would perſwade men from labouring after it; tell them private perſons need not be ſo knowing; they may be ſaved with leſs learning, and leſs teaching; a little knowledg will carry them to Heaven, if they do but live honeſtly and do their duty. And is it poſſible for a man to live honeſtly without knowledg, or do his duty without underſtanding his duty, (I add) to believe as he ſhould, without knowing what to believe? can you be religious by inſtinct? or do the will of God by gueſs, though you never inquire after it? why do they not as well tell men, that they may be rich enough, if they do but keep to their ſhops, and ſell their goods, though they do not underſtand their trade? or that they may maintain their health, if they do but eat and drink, though they cannot diſtinguiſh between meat and poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? others there be, who, if they cannot perſwade men againſt knowledg, vvill do their beſt to hinder them from the means of obtaining it. Such are the Popiſh Clergy, that keep the people from reading the Scriptures; vvould have God's revealed will kept ſecret; or known to none but themſelves, who never intend to do it; at leaſt, no more of it known, than pleaſeth <hi>Holy Church, i. e.</hi> no more than is for the intereſt of the Pope's pride, and the Prieſt's panches. Knowledg hath already done them no ſmall miſchief, and how can that chooſe but be too much light, which endangers the ruin of the kingdom of darkneſs? thus thoſe Scribes, or Jewiſh Lawyers, <hi>Luk.</hi> 11.52. <hi>Took away the key of knowledg; they entred not in themſelves</hi> into the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>and them that were entring they hindered,</hi> and 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.16. The Jews <hi>forbad the Apoſtles to preach to the Gentiles that they might be ſaved.</hi> And
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:95740:67"/> how great a ſin is it to grudg others the grace of Chriſt, and the Kingdom of God? to drive a deſign for the damnation of Souls? It is a wretched thing for Men to build their greatneſs upon the ruine of others, and rather to let thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of Souls be damned, than their ſtakes ſhould not be ſaved. Doubtleſs if they conſidered how little comfort they are like to have in Hell in the ſociety of thoſe they have brought thither, they would at leaſt be content to periſh alone.</p>

                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. What a <hi>Reproof</hi> is here for ignorant Souls? They that are ignorant, not becauſe they want the means of knowledge; but either becauſe they hate it, or becauſe they are too buſie, or too lazy, or too proud to learn? I would be-ſpeak ſuch but even in their own Language, <hi>Why ſhould you be wiſer than your forefathers, and wiſer than your teachers?</hi> They that lived before you or I were born, were fond of the truth, ſtudied the Scriptures, inquired into God's will, made his Law their <hi>meditation,</hi> their <hi>delight,</hi> their <hi>counſellor:</hi> So did <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.24, 97. Such a one was <hi>Daniel, ch.</hi> 9.2. And ſuch were other Prophets, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.11, 12. And ſuch were the Apoſtles; it was their glory to <hi>have the mind of Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. And ſuch were the primitive Chriſtians. The Beraeans were commended for ſearching the Scriptures, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.11. And ſuch the Martyrs: They would have made much of any ſingle leaf of the Bible. And why then ſhould you be wiſer than they? Why ſhould you think to be ſaved without knowledge, when they could not? Have you found out any newer, or nearer, or better way to Heaven, than they knew of? Will God be more favourable to you than to them? Will he diſpence with your ignorance, and would not with theirs? And ſo, <hi>Why muſt you needs be wiſer than your teachers?</hi> They are fain to ſtudy the Scriptures, and labour to know the will of God, and ſpend their time and ſtrength in the ſearch of truth, and count it their wiſdom ſo to do, both that they may <hi>ſave themſelves and them that hear them;</hi> And what need they go ſo far about, if there were a ſhorter cut to Heaven? What need they ſeek ſo much knowledge, if leſs would ſerve their turn? What need they weaken their bodies, and waſt their Spirits, and ſhorten their days that they may teach you <hi>the good knowledge</hi> of the Lord, and inſtruct you in the things that concern your peace, if you may be ſaved without knowing them? If ignorance were ſo innocent a thing as many think it, Miniſters might ſave their breath and ſtrength for better pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, than the teaching of thoſe that have no need of it. Is it not a great ſhame that there is ſo much ignorance among thoſe that profeſs to be enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned? Alas! How few be there that can give any tolerable account of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples they own? How few have any faith, but an implicit one? any Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on but a Traditional one? How many are themſelves guilty of what they blame in Papiſts? Papiſts believe as the Church (ſuppoſe a Councel or Pope) be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves, and how many Proteſtants believe as their Parents, or as their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters believe; And ſo <hi>their faith ſtands not in the power of God, but the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> or gifts, or parts, or Authority <hi>of Man,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.5.</p>
            <p>Uſe 3. For <hi>Exhortation. Let every one that deſires to be ſaved labour after ſuch knowledge in Spiritual things, as is moſt conducing to ſo high an end.</hi> Labour for the knowledge of the beſt things, and for as much of it as you can get. Do not be afraid of too much wiſdom, of being overcharged with Spiritual

            <p n="1">1. <hi>How uſeful this knowledg is,</hi> Prov. 15.2. <hi>That the Soul be without knowledg is not good.</hi> Knowledge in the mind is as neceſſary and uſeful, as eyes in a guide. What a <hi>Leader</hi> is to his <hi>followers,</hi>

As the eye is the overſeer of the body, ſo the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is of the whole, and therefore knowledge is as uſeful in the one, as light in the other. And as the knowledge of natural things is uſeful to a Man, as a Man, ſo is the knowledge of Spiritual things moſt uſeful to him as a Chriſtian; and that,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>In the exerciſe of holineſs,</hi> the guidance of his will and affections, and ordering of his actions in relation to his higheſt end. The Will is of it ſelf <hi>caeca facultas,</hi> a blind faculty, and the affections are no better. The will can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, but cannot judge. It hath authority over the inferior powers; but ſuch as muſt be regulated by the diſcretion of the underſtanding. And the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections are as it were the legs of the Soul: They can go this way and that way, but they muſt have the eye of the mind to ſuperintend their motion, like a blind Man carrying a lame one on his ſhoulder, who lends his own legs,<note place="margin">—<gap reason="foreign">

So that though the underſtanding's work be on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to diſcern, conſider, judge; yet without its performing that work, the will and affections can never rightly do theirs. You can never love or hate, chooſe or refuſe as you ſhould, ſuch objects as are preſented to you, unleſs you firſt paſs a right judgment upon thoſe objects, and the underſtanding determine of their being good or evil; And the underſtanding cannot judge aright, if it be not informed aright. It cannot lead you, if it be not it ſelf enlightned. You can never love God ſupremely, if your underſtandings do not judge him to be ſupremely lovely. If ever you would duly proſecute your true intereſt, you muſt be firſt acquainted with it, and have it rightly ſtated. If you would do your duty, you muſt firſt know it. You muſt of neceſſity either neglect or miſ-perform it, if you know not the rule of your doing it. Where holineſs is your work, knowledge muſt be your director. And the more knowledge you have, the more fit you will be for the practice of holineſs. The clearer your light and the better your eyes, the more circumſpectly you will walk. The more you ſee the nature, the beauty, the benefit of holineſs, the more holy you may be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Knowledge will be moſt uſeful for the <hi>Avoiding of ſin.</hi> The more know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg you have of the nature of ſin, the abundance of it in your ſelves, its of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiveneſs to God: The more knowledg you have of the rule, the exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, the purity, the Spirituality and extent of the Law: and ſo the better able you are to judge what ſin is, and what its conſequences are: the better you may eſcape it. The clearer your knowledg, and the ſtronger your convictions are of the evil of ſin, the more Arguments you are furniſhed with to perſwade your hearts againſt it. A good treaſure of Spiritual knowledg will beſt help you to maintain your Spiritual warfare. When you know not only your Leader and your weapons, and your reward; but your Enemies too, and their ſtratagems and way of lighting: you are like then to be moſt couragious in your combate</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:95740:68"/>3. Knowledg will be greatly uſeful to you for your <hi>Profiting by ordinances.</hi> The better you underſtand the nature and uſe and ends of them, the more good you are like to get by them. The more you know of the word, the more you will ſtill learn by it. If the foundation of Spiritual knowledg be well laid, Ordinances will more eaſily build you up. Not only the work of Miniſters would be more eaſie; if their hearers were better Catechized, there would not be ſuch danger of miſſing the mark, by ſhooting over peoples heads, they would not loſe ſo much labour nor ſpend ſo much ſtrength in vain, they ſhould not need ſo much to ſtudy plainneſs, and be inculcating principles, and liſping out the firſt rudiments of Religion as to thoſe that are but babes in knowledg: But hearers likewiſe would receive the word with more profit; they would more eaſily be brought down under convictions, feel the power of Exhortations, be quickned to duties, yield to reproofs, entertain admonitions, and taſt the ſweetneſs of God's conſolations, and ſo more eaſily obtain the end of their hearing. To conclude, if your underſtandings were more enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, your affections would either be ſooner warmed, or their heat be more regular; if more truth were known, more duty would be done; if our do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine were better underſtood, our application would be more effectual.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Spiritual knowledg is <hi>moſt delightful,</hi> Prov. 24.13, 14. <hi>The knowledg of wiſdom</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>to the ſoul, as the hony and hony-comb to the taſte.</hi> The knowledg of truth which is the proper object of the underſtanding doth uſually carry ſomething of pleaſure in it, and the more excellency there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in any truth, the more delectable a thing it is to know it. But there be no truths ſo excellent as Spiritual ones, ſuch as concern God and Chriſt and the myſteries of Salvation, and therefore the knowledg of none is ſo delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. What high and refined delights doth the contemplation of God in all his holy attributes and excellencies afford to glorious Angels, and <hi>the Spirits of juſt men made perfect?</hi> How do thoſe Heavenly creatures deſpiſe the groſs and faeculent pleaſures of the ſenſual World? And though Saints here upon Earth cannot riſe ſo high in their delights, becauſe not ſo high in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, yet they may find incomparably more pleaſure in knowing the things of God, even according to their preſent capacity, than the greateſt voluptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries can in the enjoyment of the creature. If a Philoſopher can take more pleaſure in the ſtudy of nature, or a Mathematician in his demonſtrations than a ſenſualiſt can in his feaſts and treatments; if lines and angles can do more for the mind of the one, than meats and drinks for the palat of the other, How far then do the delights a gracious ſoul finds in the ſtudy and ſearch of Divine truths tranſcend both? And this pleaſure is yet more heightned by the Intereſt Saints have in the truths they know; when they are not only excellent in themſelves, but of the greateſt conſequence to them. To know God, and that as their God, to know Chriſt, and that he is a Chriſt for them, to know the Saints priviledges, and that they belong to them, to know the promiſes, and that they have a ſhare in them, to know there is a Heaven, a ſtate of future glory and bleſſedneſs, and that themſelves are concerned in it, this muſt needs be a delightful knowledg. You can take ſome pleaſure in ſeeing a rich country, and pleaſant ſeat, and fine houſes, but much more if you ſee them as they that are to inherit them. If a natural man may take ſome
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:95740:68"/> pleaſure in the mere notion of divine truths; how much more may he do it that is concerned in them?</p>
            <p n="3">3. This knowledg doth greatly <hi>adorn and beautifie the Soul.</hi> It is a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of the ſoul's perfection, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.10. The <hi>Image</hi> of God is ſaid to conſiſt as in righteouſneſs and true holineſs, ſo likewiſe in <hi>knowledg.</hi> How full of it was Adam in Paridiſe? And how full of it are Angels in Heaven? The more men know of God, the more like they are to him; and the more they reſemble him, the more beautiful and perfect they are. You count a clear eye not only uſeful to the body, but a piece of beauty in it. Light in the mind is an ornament to the Soul, as well as a help. Saints in Heaven that are moſt perfect, are moſt knowing; and the fulneſs of their knowledg is a great part of their perfection.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is a moſt <hi>becoming thing,</hi> moſt ſuitable to you as Chriſtians, ſuitable to your new nature, your new ſtate, your Spiritual relations and Spiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges. It ill becomes them, who are <hi>called into Gods marvellous light,</hi> 1 Pet. 2.9. Who are the <hi>children of Light, Eph.</hi> 5.8. and the children of him who is the <hi>Father of Lights, Jam.</hi> 1.17. they that are ſaid to be <hi>in the Light,</hi> 1. <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.9. nay to be <hi>Light, Eph.</hi> 5.8. yet to he without light. An igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Saint is as great a Soloeciſm in Chriſtianity, as a Graceleſs Saint, and that is ſuch a Saint as is no Saint.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Conſider the <hi>miſchief and danger of ignorance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It expoſeth you to errors and deluſions, Math.</hi> 22.29. Who ſo apt to be miſled as he that hath no eyes? He that knows not which is the right way, may eaſily be drawn into a wrong one. <hi>He that walks in darkneſs knows not whither he goes, Joh.</hi> 12.35. Affection is a good follower, but a bad lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; It is too blind to be a guide: It embraces its object and yet knows it not. It muſt be beholden to the eye of the mind, light in the underſtanding, or elſe all its motions will be but wandrings. It will be ſure to rove, where it is not led. It is an egregious paralogiſm of them that argue againſt the tranſlation of the Scriptures into vulgar languages, that <hi>that is the way to increaſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, and diviſions among Chriſtians;</hi> For that multitude of errors which is among us, is not the effect of too much knowledg, but too little: as Mens loſing their way by day-light is not the effect of their having eyes, but either of their not having them, or not uſing them. Men do not run into errors becauſe they know the truth, but becauſe they do not know it, or are not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in it, or are not able to prove it. Not only pride and obſtinacy, but ignorance too hath a hand in Hereſies. That which is Hereſie at laſt, may be but a ſimple error at the firſt; and that too men may embrace, not ſo much, or not only, becauſe they hate the truth, but becauſe they do not know it. <hi>Perverſe diſputings of men of corrupt minds</hi> proceed from them as being <hi>deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.5. In other places we ſee by experience, that where men have ordinarily more knowledg, they have fewer errors; where they are better catechiſed, they are leſs unſound. It is ſcarce to be imagined, that ſo many abſurd and ridiculous opinions ſhould paſs currant a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us for greater truths, were it not for ignorance, as well as intereſt. And I doubt not, but many of the greateſt patrons of errors, if throughly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, would be found guilty of the deepeſt ignorance; and while they pretend
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:95740:69"/> to know more then others, they know much leſs than is needful for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. When Men walk the rounds in Religion, it is a ſign that it is night with them. It is darkneſs that fills them with ſo many fanſies and whimſies. Mens heads are moſt apt to be giddy, vvhen their eyes are cloſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It expoſeth them to wickedneſs too.</hi> When the mind is dark, no vvonder if the mind be impure. When there is no light coming in at the vvindow, the Houſe may vvell be dirty. He that cannot judge vvhat is good, and vvhat is evil, may eaſily refuſe the good and chuſe the evil. He that is ignorant of duty, may ſoon come to be prejudiced againſt it, and then diſaffected to it, and then to embrace the contrary. Crooked ſteps are but the ordinary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents of blind eyes; and none more ready to vvalk after <hi>the courſe of this World,</hi> than he that is unacquainted vvith the <hi>ways of God's Commandments;</hi> or (to invert the Apoſtle's vvords, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20.) None are more like to be <hi>Men in malice</hi> and wickedneſs, than they that are <hi>Children in underſtanding.</hi> That the <hi>Heathen, Eph.</hi> 4.18. were <hi>alienated from the life of God,</hi> it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the <hi>ignorance that was in them.</hi> I ſhall never vvonder to ſee a Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence not informed to be debauched; to ſee him that knows not God, to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect God; him that knows not duty; neglect duty, or him that is ignorant of ſin, live in ſin. And though the beginning of ſin be out of ignorance; yet Mens progreſs in it may be out of affection. If at firſt they commit it, becauſe they know not the evil and bitterneſs of it; yet they may afterward love it, vvhen they have taſted ſweetneſs in it. They that have <hi>no knowledg to do good,</hi> may the ſooner learn to be <hi>wiſe in doing evil.</hi> Mens luſts do then eſpecially rule o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, vvhen they are themſelves under the power of ignorance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Not faſhioning your ſelves according to your former luſts in your igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>It expoſeth them to Apoſtacy,</hi> even from vvhat good they profeſſed to have. How ſoon are their leaves ſhaken off from them by the ſtorms of temptation? how ſoon are they withered by the hot Sun of perſecution, vvho are not vvell rooted in Spiritual knowledge? Men will never heartily love the truth, if they ſee not its beauty; and never adhere to it, if they do not love it. An unſetled judgment vvill make unconſtant affections. I have heard of a Martyr that could not diſpute for Chriſt, and yet could burn for Chriſt; but I never heard of any that could burn for him, and yet did not know him. They that do not know the truth, the excellency, and power, and preciouſneſs of it, cannot ſee reaſon enough for their laying down their lives for it. They that know not the riches and glory of the other World, thoſe great things vvhich may deſerve their perſeverance, and encourage their reſolution and conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, vvill hardly be induced to ſecure the hope of <hi>they know not what,</hi> by the loſs of vvhat they ſee and enjoy. We may certainly ſay, that ignorance of God's truths and vvayes is one main root of Apoſtacy from them; and had m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them, vvho in theſe declining times have forſaken either, ſeen as much in them as others ſee, they might have found as good reaſon for their adhering to them, as others have found; So that to conclude this, ignorance is a ſin which expoſeth Men to temptations of all kinds: the Devil can ſcarce deſire fitter matter to work upon, than ignorant perſons. To whom ſhould he put off his wares but to thoſe that are ſo dim ſighted,<note place="margin">Eph. 6.12.</note> that they cannot perceive
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:95740:69"/> the falſeneſs of them? where ſhould <hi>the Ruler of the darkneſs of this world</hi> ſet up his Throne, erect his Kingdom of darkneſs, but in dark ſouls? where ſhould the Devil reign, but where ignorance reigns? none more obedient Vaſſals to him, than they that know not the Laws of their true Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Laſtly, <hi>Ignorance expoſeth men to Gods judgments,</hi> as well as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin doth, and thoſe not only temporal, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 5.13. but eternal too, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. Chriſt when he comes to judgment will <hi>execute vengeance on them that know not God.</hi> Thoſe that God will <hi>love,</hi> he will have them <hi>come to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the truth,</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. And even the <hi>ſervant that knows not</hi> his maſters will, ſhall have his ſhare of <hi>ſtripes, Luke</hi> 12.48. Men may periſh not only for lack of that knowledge, which is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, but for lack of that which they were bound, according to their opportunities to have gained. I have heard it as the ſaying of a learned man, <hi>that a Papiſt might be ſaved, but a Recuſant could not;</hi> as having ſufficient means for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, and information. I am not concerned to diſpute the truth of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, but ſee no reaſon to queſtion the certainty of the latter. And might it not be ſaid of many Proteſtants, that they might be ſaved in another Country, but cannot be ſaved here, and that for the ſame reaſon, becauſe here they have means of getting more knowledge? alas! how many ignorant ſouls are in Hell already, and how many more are poſting after them? when they dye there goes not only duſt to duſt, but darkneſs to darkneſs; the darkneſs of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance to the darkneſs of Hell. They will at laſt find themſelves greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that think they ſhall be ſaved becauſe they are poor ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and know no better: that is, that they ſhall be ſaved becauſe they know not the way to ſalvation; they ſhall be healed becauſe they know not wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And however they may for a time flatter themſelves, upon the account of any external priviledges, that they are Chriſtians, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, Profeſſors, yet they may read their doom in the Text, which will one day be made good upon them; and if they will not <hi>know</hi> what elſe they ſhould, yet let them <hi>know</hi> this, that <hi>Becauſe they are a people of no underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, therefore he that made them, will not have mercy on them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour.</hi>

               </list>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Generall</hi> in theſe words.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>If thou turn away thy foot from the Sabbath, from doing thy pleaſure on my holy day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein there are three things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>The thing forbidden, i. e. The doing of our pleaſures on the Sabbath.</hi> God never appointed a Sabbath for the ſatisfaction of corrupt nature.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>doing</hi> or <hi>forbearing</hi> it; and that is by <hi>turning away our foot</hi> from the Sabbath. The meaning of which phraſe may be</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) Either a turning away of our <hi>mind and affections</hi> from each objects to which corrupt will do ſtrongly incline us. <hi>The Affections are the feet of our ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>(Secondly,) <hi>Or an awful fear of treſpaſſing upon the Sabbath,</hi> for the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of our carnal deſires. As men <hi>that are afraid of</hi> treſpaſſing upon ſome great mans <hi>free-hold,</hi> withdraw their foot, and turn another way, &amp;c. The Sabbath is <hi>Gods Free-hold</hi> of which God ſaith as once to <hi>Moſes, put thy ſhooes
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:95740:70"/> from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou ſtandeſt is holy ground.</hi> When we are tempted to any thing unworthy of the Sabbath, we ſhould make a ſtop and turn away, that we may not tranſgreſs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing in the General is the <hi>reaſon,</hi> why we ſhould be ſo afraid of incroaching upon Sabbath-time, implied in this clauſe, upon <hi>my holy day.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Wherein are two conſiderations.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. It is <hi>holy</hi> time.</item>
               <item>2. It is <hi>Gods</hi> time.</item>
            </list>
            <p>To take <hi>holy time,</hi> and beſtow it upon our own <hi>luſts,</hi> it is <hi>profaneneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To take <hi>Gods time,</hi> and beſtow it upon the uſes of the fleſh, it is <hi>ſacriledge.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not fit to make ſacred time to ſerve any but <hi>ſacred uſes.</hi> This is the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inhibition.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The more <hi>particular</hi> and <hi>diſtinct inhibition</hi> followeth in the end of the verſe. Wherein,</p>
            <p>Three things forbidden in the particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are forbidden the <hi>doing of our own ways.</hi> It is an Hebraiſm as much as (in our Engliſh) <hi>going our own ways, i. e.</hi> following our carnal and ſinful courſes, purſuing our own corrupt and ſenſual inclination.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We are forbidden the <hi>finding of our own pleaſure:</hi> which is the ſame forbidden in the <hi>General, ut ſupra,</hi> only with this difference, that <hi>there</hi> (as I conceive) <hi>[pleaſure]</hi> is taken more <hi>largely:</hi> ſo, whatſoever is <hi>pleaſing</hi> to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate nature and inclinations, whether they be <hi>bodily labour</hi> or <hi>Carnal recreations, profit,</hi> or <hi>pleaſures, ſports,</hi> or the <hi>works of our Callings,</hi> we muſt not find them; that is, we muſt be ſo far from <hi>making proviſion</hi> for the ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying of the <hi>ſenſual Appetite,</hi> that we muſt not ſo much as <hi>own</hi> them, when we <hi>meet</hi> them, we muſt not ſuffer our ſelves to be tempted, or inſnared by them; we muſt be to them [when we meet them] as if we had neither <hi>eyes,</hi> nor <hi>ears,</hi> nor <hi>hands,</hi> nor <hi>feet,</hi> we muſt not deſire them, or have any thing to do with them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We are forbidden the <hi>ſpeaking of our own words,</hi> that is, our own imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent diſcourſes, worldly contrivances, or in the Apoſtles language, <hi>All filthineſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eph. 5.4. <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> 
               <hi>and fooliſh talking and jeſting, or any thing, that is not convenient:</hi> Chriſtians ſhould not only conſult what is <hi>lawful;</hi> but what is <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>ornamental</hi> to the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> None of theſe things muſt be ſo much as named <hi>on our days,</hi> much leſs on <hi>Gods days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians look to it, you may profane the Sabbath by your <hi>Words</hi> as well as your <hi>Works,</hi> and by <hi>vain words</hi> as well as by <hi>vile words.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is one thing further obſervable, that is, the note of <hi>appropriation,</hi> viz. <hi>thine own, thine own ways,</hi> thine own <hi>pleaſure,</hi> thine own <hi>words;</hi> thine own? what is that? <hi>Anſw.</hi> In oppoſition to <hi>Gods ways, Gods pleaſures, Gods words,</hi> thereby utterly excluding not only <hi>wicked ways, and ſinful pleaſures,</hi> and <hi>profane words</hi> whatſoever, which are unlawful <hi>at all times,</hi> but even all ſuch <hi>ways, pleaſures, words,</hi> and <hi>thoughts</hi> alſo (which are the words of the mind) which relate to our own private concernments, whether <hi>perſonal</hi> or <hi>domeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi> of a worldly and ſecular nature, which though they may be lawful upon <hi>other days</hi> (duly circumſtantiated) yet by no means to be allowed of on Gods day; unleſs they fall under the general <hi>exception</hi> of Gods own <hi>indulgence,</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:95740:71"/> namely <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak more largely hereafter. In a word,</p>
            <p>Nothing may be done or ſpoken, but what is of a <hi>divine</hi> or <hi>Sabbath nature</hi> and <hi>tendency,</hi> upon pain of forfeiting our part in the bleſſed <hi>priviledges</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing <hi>verſe</hi> 14. and ſo much for the <hi>negative part of Sabbath Sanctification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come to the <hi>Affirmative.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And ſhalt call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord, Honourable and ſhalt honour him.</hi> In theſe words alſo there be four branches or duties.</p>
            <list>
               <item>(1.) We muſt call the Sabbath a <hi>delight.</hi>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. If we would ſanctifie the Sabbath acceptably, we muſt call the Sabbath a <hi>delight. Call] i. e. account</hi> it ſo; calling] it is an act of the <hi>judgment,</hi> or appreciative faculty, a <hi>Delight,</hi> or (as ſome render it) <hi>thy delights,</hi> we muſt reckon the Sabbath <hi>inter Delicias,</hi> as is ſaid of <hi>Jeruſalem, Lam.</hi> 1.7. ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred all her <hi>pleaſant things,</hi> ſurely her <hi>Sabbaths</hi> were ſome of thoſe <hi>pleaſant things;</hi> it is ſaid <hi>Her enemies</hi> did <hi>mock</hi> at her <hi>Sabbaths,</hi> I, but ſhe did <hi>mourn.</hi> They were her <hi>delightful things,</hi> whereupon her heart was: And ſo they muſt be to us.

            <p n="2">2. Affirmative duty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Holy of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We muſt <hi>call it, i. e. (ut ſup.) count it, keep it,</hi> as <hi>Lichdoſh, Jehovah,
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:95740:71"/> ſanctum Domini.</hi> One of the titles of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt, The Holy one of God:</hi> we muſt obſerve the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as <hi>Holy time.</hi> Holy, yet not by <hi>conſtitution,</hi> not <hi>eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially</hi> holy as <hi>Chriſt</hi> is holy; nor <hi>inherently</hi> as <hi>the Saints</hi> are holy, but holy by <hi>inſtitution,</hi> by <hi>ſanction, relatively holy:</hi> the Lord bleſſed the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> and <hi>hallowed it, i. e.</hi> he ſet it apart for <hi>holy uſes, Deut.</hi> 5.12. keep the <hi>Sabbath-day</hi> to <hi>ſanctifie it.</hi> Nothing but holy things muſt be done in this <hi>holy time, praying, reading, hearing, ſinging of Pſalms,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92.

            <p>Thirdly, We muſt call it (<hi>i. e.</hi> count it) <hi>honourable</hi> or the <hi>glorious day of God:</hi> Glorious upon ſeveral accounts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For Gods glorious reſting upon that day. <hi>Gods reſt</hi> that is a <hi>glorious reſt, reſt of God.</hi> [As <hi>things of God</hi> in ſcripture are <hi>great</hi> and <hi>glorious things.</hi>]</p>

He did <hi>ſanctifie</hi> it. It hath Gods <hi>ſanction</hi> upon it and that is <hi>glorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It is <hi>Honourable</hi> for thoſe glorious <hi>ends</hi> for which it was ſet apart, and they are three.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That <hi>God might ſanctifie his people, Ezekiel</hi> 20.12. moreover I gave them my <hi>Sabbaths</hi> for a <hi>ſign</hi> between <hi>me</hi> and <hi>them;</hi> not a <hi>ceremonial ſign</hi> as ſome would <hi>dwindle it,</hi> that have no more <hi>Religion</hi> in them than an old rotten <hi>Ceremony cometh to,</hi> but a <hi>moral ſign, i. e. a Teſtimony, Pledge,</hi> or <hi>Covenant,</hi> whereby it might appear that they were <hi>Gods people,</hi> ſanctified to his <hi>ſervice</hi> and <hi>honour.</hi> So it follows, <hi>that they might know that I am the Lord that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifieth them.</hi> The <hi>Sabbath</hi> is Gods <hi>Medium</hi> to raiſe up to himſelf an <hi>holy people.</hi>

            <p>Fourth Duty is,</p>
            <p>As we muſt <hi>call</hi> and <hi>count it glorious,</hi> ſo we muſt <hi>actually honour it or him,</hi> (it may be rendred both) and indeed when we <hi>honour</hi> this <hi>day</hi> we <hi>glorifie God,</hi>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:95740:72"/> and we <hi>glorifie God</hi> when we make <hi>him our end</hi> in honouring his day.

            <p>Some indeed of the Antiſabbatical Doctors, who love neither the <hi>Name</hi> nor <hi>Thing,</hi> will needs expound it of the <hi>yearly</hi> Sabbath, the day of the ſtricteſt reſt among the Jews in their ſolemn convention for <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Atonement,</hi> of which we read <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.31. and 23.27.31.

                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. 3.11.</note> God ſaw the heart of man ſince the Fall ſo fixed to the <hi>world,</hi> and immerſed in the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Profits</hi> thereof, that had he left man to himſelf, he would not have ſpared for Divine worſhip one day in <hi>ſeven weeks,</hi> not poſſibly in <hi>ſeven months,</hi> or in the <hi>whole year,</hi> but he would have even drudg'd himſelf and the irrational Creature to death in the purſuit of worldly fruitions.

                  </note> this day God was pleaſed to honour with the <hi>title</hi> of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> as both here, and in the <hi>fourth Commandment,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>reſt,</hi> becauſe on this day, both <hi>God the Father</hi> and <hi>God the Son</hi> reſpectively,<note place="margin">Gen. 2.2.</note> did reſt from
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:95740:73"/> their own proper work: and by their precept and pattern command it and commend it for a <hi>ſtated reſt</hi> to the Church of God for ever.</p>
               <p>What the reaſon therefore is why <hi>ſome learned men</hi> of our generation ſhould be ſo exceedingly offended at that name <hi>[Sabbath]</hi> that they cannot ſo much as hear it with patience, is to me a wonder even to aſtoniſhment; And while they are ſo much offended at the <hi>name,</hi> the vulgar ſort of Chriſtians, are (there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I am afraid) as much offended at the <hi>thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe, I have heard ſome ſay they like it not, becauſe it is <hi>Jewiſh;</hi> but to that we reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Not the <hi>Jews,</hi> but the <hi>God of the Jews</hi> gave it that name here and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, and</p>
               <p n="2">2. The notion of a <hi>Sabbath</hi> ſignifies no more but <hi>Reſt;</hi> and is <hi>Reſt Jewiſh?</hi> Oh that men would look into their hearts to ſee whether the reaſon of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt is not more latent there.</p>
               <p n="3">3. And were it a <hi>Jewiſh name</hi> (indeed) is not the <hi>Jewiſh name [Sabbath]</hi> better than the <hi>Heatheniſh</hi>-name <hi>[Sunday]?</hi> The name which Heatheniſh Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters gave it in their Dedication of that day to the <hi>Created Sun?</hi> Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding conſult their <hi>Calenders, Writings</hi> and <hi>Languages,</hi> and you can meet with no other <hi>name</hi> or <hi>notion,</hi> but <hi>Sunday</hi> all over. At this we have more cauſe to be offended, than they have at the notion of a <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As for the vulgar ſort of people; it is the <hi>thing</hi> which offends them more than the <hi>name;</hi> not the Reſt ſo much as the <hi>Nature</hi> of the Reſt, is that which they diſlike; were it a <hi>Carding</hi> Reſt, a <hi>Gaming</hi> Reſt, a <hi>Dancing</hi> Reſt, ſuch an one as the Iſraelites once celebrated in the wilderneſs, wherein they <hi>did eat and drink, and roſe up to play:</hi> (ſuch an one for all the world as the Popiſh De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion celebrates) after <hi>Maſs</hi> and <hi>Even Song,</hi> (as they call it) <hi>pipe</hi> and <hi>dance,</hi> and then to the <hi>Ale-houſe</hi> or <hi>Tavern;</hi> ſuch a Reſt would gratifie the ſenſual world of carnal Chriſtians: but for an <hi>holy reſt,</hi> a reſt to be ſpent in <hi>Publick, Domeſtick,</hi> and <hi>Secret</hi> duties of Religion; <hi>Reading the Scriptures, praying, ſinging of Pſalms, Hearing the word preach't, repeating at home</hi> what they heard <hi>in publique, Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſing</hi> their <hi>families, Meditation,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe things do not pleaſe the <hi>unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate part,</hi> but men are ready to murmur, as they did of old, what a <hi>wearineſs</hi> is it, and <hi>when will the Sabbath be over,</hi>

               <p>We muſt look upon the Sabbath as a <hi>day of Divine Inſtitution;</hi> not of an humane ordination: the Sabbath hath a <hi>jus divinum</hi> written upon it, more <hi>authentique</hi> than theirs that <hi>decry</hi> it: <hi>My holy day,</hi> and <hi>the holy of the Lord,</hi> twice in this 13. verſe, and this not in reference only to the ſeventh <hi>day</hi> but in reference to the <hi>firſt day of the week,</hi> which this Evangelical Prophet had then (by divine revelation) in his eye. How much more doth it concern us, who are reſerved to this <hi>glorious Adminiſtration</hi> under the Goſpel, to own the Divine right of the <hi>Evangelical Sabbath?</hi> Surely it is the voice of the glorious Trinity that calls it, <hi>my holy day;</hi> God the <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> by <hi>Creation,</hi> God the <hi>Son</hi> by <hi>Redemption,</hi> and God the <hi>Holy Ghoſt</hi> by <hi>Sanctification,</hi> ſending down a rich and plentiful <hi>effuſion of Gifts</hi> and <hi>Graces</hi> upon the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for the enabling them to go forth and convert

               </p>
               <p>We learn from hence that we muſt give God the whole <hi>Entire day,</hi> my <hi>day</hi> ſaith God: a <hi>few hours,</hi> or the <hi>forenoon</hi> vvill not ſerve Gods turn: but he challengeth the <hi>whole time,</hi> as his own <hi>peculiar.</hi>

               <p>There is a great diſpute amongſt Divines, <hi>when the Sabbath begins,</hi> and <hi>when it ends?</hi> the text determineth the controverſie, ſaith God <hi>all is mine.</hi> The vvhole 24 hours is <hi>Sabbath:</hi> look <hi>how many hours</hi> vve reckon to <hi>our</hi> days, ſo many hours vve muſt reckon to <hi>Gods</hi> days alſo, if vve vvill be ingenuous.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The occaſional Sabbaths amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> gave them a greater <hi>latitude:</hi> no more time of thoſe days being counted holy, than was ſpent in the <hi>publique ſervice</hi> of the day; which continued but from nine of the clock in the morning when the <hi>morning ſacrifice</hi> was to be offered; and ended at three of the clock in the afternoon, at evening ſacrifice.

               <p>The Sabbath is <hi>polluted by words as well as by works.</hi> Chriſt will judge men in the <hi>great day for their words:</hi> and <hi>by them</hi> will he either <hi>juſtifie</hi> thee for <hi>ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying</hi> the Sabbath, or <hi>condemn</hi> thee for <hi>profaning</hi> of it. I am afraid it is the great controverſie God hath with this <hi>nation:</hi> not only <hi>profane,</hi> but even <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors,</hi> are all guilty of not <hi>ſanctifying the name</hi> and <hi>Day of God</hi> in their <hi>talk</hi> and <hi>diſcourſes</hi> upon the <hi>Sabbath Day.</hi> If Jeſus Chriſt ſhould join himſelf to our <hi>Tables,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luke 24.15, 16, 17.</note> or leſſer companies, as he did with the two Diſciples going to Emaus, and ask us, <hi>what manner of communications are theſe which ye have one with another;</hi> how might the queſtion <hi>fill our faces with paleneſs and ſtrike us ſpeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Alaſs who can tell <hi>what day</hi> it is by mens diſcourſes and conferences one with another! how <hi>vain, fooliſh, unprofitable</hi> and <hi>unſavory</hi> is moſt mens ſpeech <hi>all the day!</hi> no jeſt ſo <hi>idle,</hi> no ſtory ſo <hi>common</hi> and <hi>fruitleſs,</hi> but will paſs at our tables and in our private conference.</p>
               <p>Many ſpend the <hi>beſt of their time</hi> no better than the <hi>Idolatrous Athenians</hi> did their worſt, in <hi>nothing elſe but either telling or hearing ſome new thing. What news?</hi> is the moſt innocent queſtion, wherewith (I would I could not
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:95740:74"/> ſay) moſt men fill up the vacancies of a Sabbath. And is that ſinful will you ſay? was it not in Nehemiah's queſtion, Nehem. 1.2. <hi>Hanani one of my brethren came, he and certain men of Judah, and I asked them concerning the Jews that had eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped, which were of the Captivity, and concerning</hi> Jeruſalem, &amp;c. preſently <hi>what news?</hi> And why may not Chriſtians ask the ſame <hi>queſtion?</hi> yes, they may, when they ask it with Nehemiah's ſpirit, to Nehemiah's end, <hi>ſc.</hi> that we may get our hearts ſutably affected with the miſeries or proſperity of the Church of God <hi>abroad</hi> or at <hi>home:</hi> ſee what a gracious uſe he makes of his news in that and in the following chapter at your leiſure: go ye, and do <hi>likewiſe,</hi> and it ſhall be your honour.</p>
               <p>But to tell <hi>news,</hi> and to <hi>inquire</hi> after <hi>news</hi> meerly for <hi>novelty ſake,</hi> and to fill up time for want of better diſcourſe: is a miſerable <hi>idling</hi> out of <hi>precious</hi> time, which might be ſpent to mutual <hi>edification;</hi> whereas by ordinary and unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury diſcourſes which are uſually heard amongſt us, people do <hi>edifie</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther indeed, but it is</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ad Gehennam,</hi> they edifie one another to hell. You that pretend to be the <hi>Lords people</hi> be more jealous for the <hi>Lords day</hi> and <hi>honour. The Lord takes plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in his people. Oh let the Saints be joyful in glory.</hi>

               <p>Surely the Sabbath is the very ſpring upon which the <hi>holy converſation</hi> of the whole week is turned and moved.</p>
               <p>And therefore it is obſervable that the Sabbath ſtands as it were betwixt the <hi>two Tables,</hi> the <hi>laſt precept</hi> of the <hi>firſt Table,</hi> and the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond,</hi>

               <p>Such extraordinary impulſes and raviſhments are not every Chriſtians at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment, and muſt not be imitated to the prejudice of the <hi>Body, the ſpirit may be willing, but the fleſh is weak:</hi> but certainly every Chriſtian that hath the love of Chriſt ſhed abroad in his heart will be careful to abate himſelf ſomewhat of his wonted indulgences on that morning which was his redeemers <hi>Birth-day,</hi> that he may have time to get on his wedding Garment by <hi>meditation,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal 2.7.</note> 
                  <hi>reading</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> that he may go forth to meet him whom his <hi>ſoul loveth</hi> in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ſolemnities of the Sabbath: and bring him home with him into the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of her that conceived him.<note place="margin">Cant. 3.</note>
               </p>
               <p>This is to call the day <hi>Honourable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Then we call it Honourable, when we have a precious eſteem of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very moment of <hi>Sabbath-time,</hi> and jealous leſt any <hi>drop</hi> of it ſhould run waſte; even the <hi>filings of Gold</hi> and the <hi>duſt of Diamonds</hi> are <hi>pretious.</hi> No man can call the Sabbath <hi>Glorious</hi> that ſets light by an <hi>hour,</hi> or <hi>minute,</hi> or <hi>moment</hi> of ſo <hi>Divine</hi> a creation. Time is <hi>a ring of Gold,</hi> but the Sabbath is the <hi>rich ſparkling Diamond</hi> in it.</p>

               <p>It is like his ſeamleſs coat, and cannot be divided without ſacriledge.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, The day is honourable when we have a ſingular eſteem of all the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> and <hi>Ordinances</hi> of the day. When <hi>Prayer</hi> is precious, and the <hi>word Read, Preached,</hi> is precious, when <hi>ſinging of Pſalms</hi> is precious, the <hi>Sacraments</hi> precious: when every one in its <hi>time</hi> and <hi>order</hi> is obſerved with ſuch due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that none do juſtle out or exclude the other, but one doth catch in the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, as the links in a chain of Gold.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, When it is the grief of our ſouls that we can keep Sabbaths no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſtrive cordially and conſcientiouſly to keep the next better than we did the laſt.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, and laſtly, when we are careful that all ours as well as our ſelves keep Sabbaths: this is a main clauſe in our obedience to the 4th commandment. <hi>Thou,</hi> thy <hi>Son</hi> and thy <hi>Daughter,</hi> thy <hi>man-ſervant,</hi> and thy <hi>maid-ſervant,</hi> &amp;c. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one in their ſeveral capacities muſt keep the Sabbath.</p>
               <p>To be ſtrict our ſelves in the duties of a Sabbath, and careleſs what the reſt of our Families do (whether our children or ſervants) ſteep or be idle, <hi>dance</hi> or <hi>play at cards,</hi> ſing idle ſongs, or take Gods name in vain, &amp;c.</p>

            <p>For the reſolution of this queſtion, I ſhall firſt tell you what we mean by the word. Secondly, what by profiting. And thirdly, how we ſhall profit by the hearing of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1.

But if under Hearing you do not ſee the ſins that reign in you, as pride covetouſneſs, paſſion, if you do not confeſs them heartily before God, if you do not mourn kindly for them, nor leave them, you hear without profit.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Content not your ſelves with the bare reading of Scripture, but labour to find ſome ſpiritual increment and profit. Get the Word tranſcribed into your hearts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.31. <hi>The Law of God is in his heart.</hi> Never leave till you are aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milated into the Word. Such as profit by reading of the Book of God are the beſt Chriſtians alive; they anſwer God's coſt, they credit Religion, they ſave their Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You who have profited by reading the Holy Scriptures, adore God's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhing grace. Bleſs God that he hath not only brought the light to you, but opened your eyes to ſee it; that he hath unlocked his <hi>hid Treaſure,</hi> and enriched you with ſaving knowledge. Some periſh by not <hi>having</hi> Scripture, and others by not <hi>improving</hi> it. That God ſhould paſs by Millions in the World, and the <hi>Lot</hi> of his Electing Love ſhould fall upon you; that the Scripture like the <hi>pillar of Cloud</hi> ſhould have a <hi>dark-ſide</hi> to others, but a <hi>light-ſide</hi> to you; that to others it ſhould be a <hi>dead letter,</hi> but to you the <hi>Savour of Life;</hi> that Chriſt ſhould not only be revealed <hi>to</hi> you but <hi>in</hi> you, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.16. How ſhould you be in an holy extaſie of wonder, and wiſh that you had hearts of <hi>Seraphims</hi> burning in love to God, and the voices of Angels to make Heaven ring with God's Praiſes?</p>

            <p n="3">3: The manner of Singing.

               </note> here we muſt act our joy, our confidence, our delight. Singing is the triumph of a gracious Soul; the Child joying in the praiſes of his Father. In ſinging of Pſalms, the <hi>gracious</hi> heart takes wings, and mounts up to God, to joyn with the Celeſtial Quire. It is <hi>grace</hi> which ſits the heart for, and ſweetens the heart in this duty. And where this qualification is wanting, this ſervice is rather an <hi>hurry</hi> than a <hi>duty;</hi> it is rather a <hi>diſturbance</hi> than any <hi>obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. The Maſter of the Chore, the Preceptor, that is, the <hi>Heart.</hi> We muſt look to the Heart in ſinging, that it be purged by the Spirit, and that it be replete with ſpiritual Affection. He plays the Hypocrite who brings not the heart to this Duty. One obſerves, There is no Tune without the Heart; Singing takes its proper riſe from the Heart;
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:95740:92"/> the Voice is only the further progreſs. And indeed God is the Creator of <hi>the whole man;</hi> and therefore he will be praiſed not only with our Tongues, but with our Hearts. The Apoſtle tells us, He will ſing with <hi>the ſpirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.15.

And <hi>Bernard</hi> tells us in a Tract of his, <hi>That when we ſing Pſalms, let us take heed that we have the ſame thing in our Mind, that we warble forth in our Tongue; and that our Song and our Heart do not run ſeveral ways.</hi> If we in ſinging only offer the Calves of our Lips, it will too much reſemble a Carnal and a Jewiſh ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The End of the Duty; <hi>To the Lord.</hi> So ſaith the Text, <hi>viz.</hi> To Jeſus Chriſt, who is here principally meant. Our ſinging muſt not ſerve our Gain, or our Luxury, or our Fancy, but our Chriſt, our Lord, and dear Redeemer. In this Duty it is his Praiſes we muſt mainly and chiefly celebrate. And moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly we magnifie the true God by Pſalms and Singing, when the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens celebrate their falſe and dung-hill-Gods, <hi>Jupiter, Neptune,</hi> and <hi>Apol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> with Songs and Hymns. One well obſerves, Singing of Pſalms is part of Divine Worſhip,<note place="margin">Deus est ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nendi <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nicus Scopus. <hi>Bod.</hi>
               </note> and of our Homage and Service due to the great Jehovah. <hi>Bodius</hi> takes notice, that God is the true and only ſcope of all our ſinging. And truly if the Spirit of God be in us, he will be ſteddily aimed at by us. Thus <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Barak</hi> ſang their Triumphal Song to the Lord, <hi>Judges</hi> 5.3.</p>
            <p>The ſeveral parts of the Text being thus opened, they may be ſet together again in this Divine and Excellent Truth.</p>

               </note>
               <hi>In the Ordinance of Singing, we muſt not make Noiſe, but Muſick; and the Heart muſt make Melody to the Lord.</hi> So the Text. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> complained of ſome in his time, <hi>That they minded more the Tune than the Truth; more the Manner than the Matter; more the Governing of the Voice, than the Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of the Mind:</hi> And this was a great offence to him. Singing of Pſalms muſt only be the joyous breathing of a raiſed Soul; and here the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Heart is more conſiderable than the clearneſs of the Voice. In this Service we muſt ſtudy more to act the Chriſtian than the Muſitian. Many in ſinging of Pſalms are like the Organs, whoſe Pipes are filled only with Wind. The Apoſtle, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. tells us, we muſt ſing with our Heart. We muſt ſing <hi>David</hi>'s Pſalms with <hi>David</hi>'s Spirit. One tells us, God is a Spirit; and he will be worſhipped in Spirit even in this duty.</p>
            <p>Now to traverſe the Truth. 1. We will ſhew the Divine Authority of this Ordinance. 2. We will ſhew the Sweetneſs of it. 3. The Univerſal Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of it. 4. We ſhall ſhew the Honours God hath put upon this Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. 5. And then come to the main Caſe. 6. And make Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
            <p>For the firſt, We ſhall ſhew the Divine Authority of this Ordinance. 1. By Scripture-Command. 2. By Scripture-Argument. 3. By Scripture-Pattern. 4. By Scripture-Propheſie.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="177" facs="tcp:95740:92"/>1. From Scripture-Precept: And here we have divers commands laid upon us, both in the Old and New Teſtament. <hi>David,</hi> who among his honourable Titles obtains this, to be called the Sweet Singer of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> 2 Sam. 23.1. he frequently calls upon himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.17. <hi>I will ſing Praiſe to the Name of the Lord moſt High.</hi> And ſometimes he calls upon others, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Sing unto him, ſing Pſalms unto him, and tell of his wondrous Works.</hi> Nay, ſometimes he ſummons the whole Earth to join in this duty, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 68.32. <hi>Sing unto the Lord all the Earth, ſhew forth from day to day his Salvation.</hi> And holy <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he propagated this ſervice, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. Nay, in their times when the Royal Majeſty was lodg'd in <hi>Judah, Singers</hi> were a peculiar Office enjoined conſtantly to ſing the Praiſes of the Lord, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 10.12. And <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> appointed <hi>Singers,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.21. Nay, and <hi>Aſaph, Heman, Jeduthun,</hi> and <hi>Ethan,</hi> men eminent and holy, were employed in this holy ſervice, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12. But why ſhould I light a Candle at Noon-day? Thus this harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſervice was moſt uſual, and moſt acceptable in the times <hi>of the Law.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I need not ſtraggle from <hi>my Text</hi> to bring in Goſpel-Precept for this ſweet Ordinance: And the Apoſtle takes care to acquaint other Churches with the ſame injunction. So <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.16.<note place="margin">Col. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>Teaching and admoniſhing one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother in Pſalms and Hymns, and ſpiritual Songs; ſinging with grace in your hearts to the Lord.</hi> And ſo firmly the Apoſtle ſtates this Muſical Service, this exhilarating Ordinance, that he himſelf act; his own injunction, though fettered in a Priſon, and makes <hi>Barnabas</hi> a Companion of his Song as well as of his Sorrows, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="2">2. From Scripture-Argument: And I ſhall only take out one ſhaft out of the whole Quiver. I ſhall uſe one Argument among many, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> We always find this duty of ſinging Pſalms linked to and joyned with other Moral Duties. Thus the Pſalmiſt joyns Singing and Prayer together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 95.1, 6. <hi>O come, let us ſing unto the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 95.1.6.</note> in the firſt Verſe. <hi>O come, let us worſhip and fall down, and kneel before the Lord our Maker,</hi> in the ſixth Verſe. There is Prayer and Singing connexed; Singing being ſuppoſed to be of equal neceſſity and authority with other Ordinances. And ſo the Apoſtle <hi>James, Jam.</hi> 5.3. joins theſe two together; <hi>Is any among you afflicted? let him pray: Is any merry? let him ſing Pſalms.</hi> So you may obſerve, both theſe Services are equally calculated for man's neceſſity.<note place="margin">

               </note> Thus <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> join them in their practice, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. And ſo <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in his 117. Queſtion <hi>ad Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxos</hi> tells us, that in his time <hi>They Sang, and ſent up Prayers to God,</hi> the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Church confirming <hi>David</hi>'s Injunction, and the Apoſtolical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. So that by theſe inſtances we may obſerve, That the duty of <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>Singing</hi> have walk'd in the ſame equipage, and lay claim to an equal Authority from Divine Writ; the Scripture jointly favouring both.</p>
            <p n="3">3. From Scripture-Pattern. <hi>Moſes</hi> both pens a Pſalm, <hi>viz.</hi> the Nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:95740:93"/> and ſings a Holy Song, and the 15th of <hi>Exodus, Is the record of it.</hi> So Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid tripudiates in the practice of this delightful ſervice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.33.<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.33.</note> Nay David compoſeth <hi>Pſalms</hi> and Hezekiah appoints them to be Sung, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. So David, and Aſaph, Hezekiah, and the Levites, all join to Sing forth the praiſes of the Lord. Nay our deareſt Jeſus, the King of Saints, and the Redeemer of Mankind practiſeth this ſweet duty, and calls in his bleſſed Apoſtles to make up the Quire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30.<note place="margin">Rev. 15.3. Mat. 26.30.</note> 
               <hi>And when they had Sung an Hymn, they went up into the Mount of Olives.</hi> Our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour honours this Ordinance with his own practice; and this he did a little before his death, ſo to ſeal this Ordinance with his blood as well as to conſecrate it with his lips. Thus this Celeſtial Quire of Chriſt and his Apoſtles ſix this ſweet Ordinance in the Church for future ſucceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. From Scripture-Propheſie; And here I may ſpeak of Singing as Paul ſpeaks of Timothy's Ordination, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. It was given <hi>by Propheſie.</hi> There are divers <hi>Propheſies</hi> in the Old Teſtament concerning this Ordinance in the New. So in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.2. Upon which <hi>Mollerus</hi>

And there are two things which not only eſtabliſh, but ſweeten and honour an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, 1. <hi>Promiſes,</hi> 2. <hi>Propheſies.</hi> Chriſt himſelf was the fruit and iſſue of both.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we may take notice <hi>of the ſweetneſs</hi> of this Duty: Singing is the Soul's Jubilee; Our Spiritual recreation; The ſhout of the heart; Our tuning of our Hallelujahs; The ſweeteſt ſolace of a Sanctified Soul. David was in a kind of rapture, when he cries out, <hi>I will Sing praiſe to the Lord while I have my being, Pſal.</hi> 104.33.<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.33.</note> One well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of Singing, There is a dilating of the ſound, and a drawing out of the voice which gives more tïme for the fixing of the heart upon that which is Sung, and ſo puts the Soul upon a ſweeter Meditation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4, 34.<note place="margin">Pſal. 104.34.</note> And we may animadvert it, That when we Sing Pſalms, there is more than ordinary raiſing and lifting up of the Soul, there is an elevation to a higher degree of Communion with God. It is the Soul's high Mount towards Heaven, the Saint flies higher towards the Element and Sphere of joy; Then we are fledged for ſublime things. One aſſerts, There is not a greater reſemblance of Heaven upon Earth, than a company of God's people Singing a Pſalm together; Then the Soul rejoyceth in Divine goodneſs, and exults in Divine excellencies, meditates on Divine promiſes. And whatever
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:95740:93"/> we make <hi>the matter</hi> of our Singing it will much affect the heart. 1. If we Sing <hi>of God,</hi> Of his goodneſs, It inflames our heart to love; Of his Wiſdom, It raiſeth our heart to admiration, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.33. Of his Power, It engageth the heart to Faith and Confidence; Nay of his Judgments, It over-awes the heart to a due and reverential Fear. 2. If we Sing of any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning our ſelves, If for the diverſion of a trouble, It fills the heart <hi>with humility:</hi> If for the obtaining of a mercy, It boils up the heart <hi>in Deſire.</hi> 3. If we Sing of our Enemies, This likewiſe draws the heart to a juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation, Zeal and Compaſſion. The <hi>very matter</hi> we Sing doth abundantly ſweeten this Duty. Nay further,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Singing is the muſick of <hi>Nature.</hi> The Scriptures tell us, the Mountains Sing, <hi>Jer.</hi> 44.23. The valleys Sing, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.13.

The <hi>Rabbies</hi> tell us, That the <hi>Jews</hi> after the feaſt of the Paſſeover was celebrated, they ſang the 111 Pſalm and the five following Pſalms; and our Saviour and his Apoſtles ſang an HYMN immediately after the Bleſſed Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30.<note place="margin">Mat. 26.30.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Singing is the Muſick of <hi>Saints.</hi> 1. They have performed this duty in their greateſt <hi>numbers,</hi> Pſal. 149.2. 2.

And indeed it is meet that the Saints and ſervants of God ſhould Sing forth their joyes and praiſes to the Lord Almighty: Every Attribute of him can ſet both their Song and their Tune.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Singing is the Muſick of <hi>Angels:</hi> Job tells us, <hi>The Morning Stars Sang together,</hi> Job 38.7. Now theſe Morning Stars, as <hi>Pineda</hi>

            <p>Now thirdly, we come to ſhew the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal practice</hi> of this Duty: Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pſalms and Spiritual Songs to God is not more <hi>ſweet</hi> than <hi>Oecumenical;</hi> It hath been always the way of Saints thus to expreſs their joy in the Lord.— This Duty hath been practiſed:</p>
            <p n="1">1. By all varieties of Perſons. 1. <hi>By Chriſt and his Apoſtles</hi> (as hath been ſhown) <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.30. The glorious Sun and Stars have ſhined in favour upon this joyous Service, and left their practice of it upon Record; The Supernal and upper Orders of the World have not been too high for this Spiritual Harmony. 2. <hi>Godly Princes</hi> have glorified God in this Duty, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.30. Their Thrones have not raiſed them above this Spiritual ſervice. King <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> aſſaults his enemies not only with the brandiſhing of his Sword, but with the Singing of his Song, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.21. Princes who have ſwayed regal Scepters, have ſang Spiritual Songs, and have minded <hi>the Quire</hi> as well as <hi>the Crown. David</hi> not only takes the Scepter into his hand to rule the people, but takes the <hi>Harp</hi> into his hand to ſing the praiſes of the Lord. 3. <hi>Worthy Governours. Nehemiah</hi> takes care, that as ſoon as the wall of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> was ſet up, Singers ſhould be appointed to perform this part of God's Worſhip, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 7.1. Theſe Eminent Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates held not only the reins of Government, but lifted up thoſe hands which held them with the voices in Singing the Praiſes of God. Magiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is a ſpur, not a curb to Duty. I need not mention <hi>Ethan, Heman,</hi> and <hi>Aſaph,</hi> Eminent and Worthy Men, engaged in this pleaſing ſervice, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5.12. 4. <hi>Holy Prophets.</hi> They did not only propheſie of things to come, but they practiſed Duties for the preſent, more eſpecially this. And as <hi>David</hi> pens <hi>Prophetical,</hi> ſo he ſings <hi>Muſical</hi> Pſalms, and profeſſes his dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and his ſinging Air ſhould both expire together, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 146.2.<note place="margin">Pſal. 146.2.</note> This Duty ſhould lye by him on his Death-bed; and as <hi>Moſes</hi> in the 32 Chapter of <hi>Deuteronomy,</hi> he will cloſe up his life with a Swan-like, with a Saint-like Song. So the 22 Chapter of the ſecond of <hi>Samuel</hi> was a ſong of Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving for manifold mercies, a little before his death. 5. <hi>The body of the People.</hi> As Singing is not too low for Kings, ſo not too choice for Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; the whole multitude ſometimes engaged in the harmony. <hi>Then Iſrael Sang this Song, Numb.</hi> 21.17. The Peoples voice may make melo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as the leſſer birds contribute to the Muſick of the Grove, their chirp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing notes filling up the harmony. 6. <hi>Eminent Fathers: Baſil</hi>

            <p n="2">
               <pb n="181" facs="tcp:95740:94"/>2. In all Ages. This ſervice of Singing to God was ſoon ſtarted in the World; <hi>Moſes</hi> the firſt Penman of Scripture, he both Sung a Song, and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned a Pſalm, as we hinted before. In the Judges time, <hi>Deborah</hi> and <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rak</hi> Sang a Triumphant Song, <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.1, 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> During the time of the Kings of <hi>Judah,</hi> the <hi>Levites</hi> ſang the praiſes of God in the Sanctuary. A little before the Captivity we find the Church praiſing God in Singing, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 35.2. In the time of the Captivity, <hi>Iſrael</hi> did not forget the Songs of <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> though they were in <hi>Babylon, Pſal.</hi> 126.2. After their return from Captivity, we ſoon find them return to this joyous Service, <hi>Neh.</hi> 7.1. their long Exile had not baniſhed this Duty. Towards the cloſe of their Prophets propheſying, the Church is again engaged in this part of God's Worſhip, <hi>Zeph.</hi> 3.15, 17. In the beginning of the Chriſtian <hi>Aera,</hi> when the Goſpel firſt made the World happy with its glorious ſhine, we find the primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians much taken up in this Duty; <hi>Cyprian</hi> in his Epiſtle to <hi>Donatus,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Nec eſt hora Convivii Cae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtis gratiae immunis, Sonet Pſalmis convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vium Sobrium. <hi>Cypr.</hi>
               </note> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth, <hi>That there may not be an hour of feaſting without ſome Heavenly grace, and let every ſober feaſt be accompanied with Singing of Pſalms.</hi> And Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome in his Commentary on the 41th Pſalm admoniſhes all perſons, <hi>Countrey-men, Marrines, Weavers,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>to ſing Pſalms and ſpiritual Songs. Eſtius</hi> cries out, Take notice of the cuſtome of the Primitive Chriſtians, who did not only ſing Pſalms and Hymns in their publique Aſſemblies, but in their private Families. <hi>Euſebius</hi> relates, That <hi>Plinius Secundus</hi> in an Epiſtle he wrote to <hi>Trajan</hi> the Emperour <hi>makes mention, that the Chriſtians of thoſe times being gathered together before day, Sang Hymns and Praiſes to Chriſt, as to a God.</hi> This was about the year 98 after the birth of our Saviour: Thoſe early and more pure times rejoyced in this Duty. <hi>Nicephorus</hi> tells us, that <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> cauſed Pſalms to be Sung for the ſuppreſſion of the <hi>Arrian</hi> Hereſie. And <hi>Ruffin</hi> witneſſeth, That <hi>Baſil</hi> commanded the people to meet <hi>for the pouring out of their prayers to God, and for ſinging of Pſalms to the Moſt High.</hi> The worthy <hi>Junius</hi> informs us, That the Eaſtern Church from the time the Sun of Righteouſneſs aroſe in the Eaſt did propagate the practice of Singing of Pſalms to ſucceſſive Generations. And <hi>Paulinus</hi> teſtifies,<note place="margin">Per omnes penè Occidentis pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincias ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naſſe refert. <hi>Paulin.</hi>
               </note> That this practice overſpread every Province of the Weſtern Church. Holy <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſo zealouſly preſſed this Duty of Singing Pſalms, that he would not allow times of perſecution to be a ſufficient excuſe for the neglect of it; But the Empreſs <hi>Juſtina</hi> raging againſt <hi>Ambroſe, He commanded the Common people to lye in the Church, and there Sing Pſalms and Hymns according to the practice of the Oriental Chriſtians, that they might not be ſenſible of their ſorrows or tediouſneſs. And this Cuſtome prevailed in after times, and was ſcattered in other places, the Churches in other parts imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Worthy Practice.</hi> This then was the Genius of the primitive Times.</p>
            <p>In the middle times of the Church, <hi>Rabanus Maurus,</hi> and <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great, mention this ſervice with great approbation, and ſpeak liberally of the practice of it.</p>
            <p>But ſince the Reformation, the univerſal practice of the Reformed Churches give free ſuffrage to the Duty of Singing Pſalms; and I need
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:95740:95"/> not cite <hi>Zanchy,</hi> &amp;c. to give in their teſtimony, our judgments being beſt diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by our practiſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In all places. <hi>Moſes</hi> praiſeth God by ſinging in the <hi>Wilderneſs,</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the 15th Chapter of <hi>Exodus.

Chriſt and his Apoſtles <hi>in a particular Chamber, Mat.</hi> 26.30. And <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> in an <hi>uncomfortable Priſon, Act.</hi> 19.25. We may ſay of Singing, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of Prayer, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands;</hi> Thus every place is now Commodious for lifting up pure voices and pure hearts to the Moſt High. Where devout Chriſtians meet in any convenient place <hi>to ſing praiſes</hi> to the Lord, they make up a Heavenly Quire.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In all Conditions. 1. <hi>In a time of chearfulneſs and inward joy.</hi> The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> commands us then to take the advantage of ſinging Pſalms, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. Holy Singing is the beſt Exertion of inward rejoycing; Joy may excite, muſt not ſtifle this Duty. A dilated heart is fitteſt for a raiſed voice. 2. <hi>In a time of affliction. Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> ſang in Priſon, a place of ſorrow and confinement, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. A chain might bind their feet, but not their tongue; while others ſleep, they ſing, and turn their Dungeon into a Chappel. Holy ſinging can nobilitate every Duty, and raiſe it to a better Notion. 3. <hi>In a time of Fear.</hi> When ſome would preſs <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> with the dangers the Church was in, and what a black Cloud hung over Zion, he would preſently call for the 46th Pſalm to be ſung, and he thought that Pſalm was a charm againſt all fears whatſoever.

Then the Houſe was filled with a Cloud, even the Houſe of the Lord.</hi> The Cloud was a certain ſign of Divine preſence in thoſe times.

            <p n="2">2. We muſt ſing <hi>with affection. Love</hi> is the fulfilling of this Law.

It is love, not skill, makes the Muſick and the Service moſt pleaſing. When we go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout this Work, we muſt lay our Book before us; a heart full of love. The Primitive Chriſtians ſang Hymns to Chriſt, whom they entirely loved. Love indeed is that ingredient which ſweetens and indulcorates every Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We muſt ſing <hi>with real Grace.</hi> This the Apoſtle admoniſhes us, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.16. It is <hi>Grace,</hi> not <hi>Nature,</hi> ſweetens the Voice to ſing. We muſt draw out our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, our Graces, in this Duty. The Hundred forty four thouſand, which were Elected and Glorified Saints, ſang the New ſong, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.3.

               <hi>Gorran</hi> well notes, That Grace is the Root of <hi>true</hi> Devotion. Wicked men only make a noiſe, they do not ſing; they are like crackt Strings of a Lute or a Viol, they <hi>ſpoil,</hi> they do not <hi>make</hi> Muſick. <hi>The Righteous rejoice in the Lord,</hi> Pſal. 33.1. The Raven croaks, the Nightingale ſings the Tune. As God will not hear Sinners when they <hi>pray,</hi> ſo neither when they <hi>ſing;</hi> the ſinging of Wicked men is diſturbance, not obedience. Indeed the Saints ſinging is a more <hi>ſolemn Ovation,</hi> Praiſing Him who cauſeth them to triumph in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. The Saints above ſing their Hallelujahs <hi>in Glory,</hi> and the Saints below muſt ſing their Pſalms <hi>with Grace.</hi> Faſhion Puppets as you pleaſe, they cannot ſing; it is the alive Bird can chirrup that pleaſing noiſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. We muſt ſing <hi>with excited Grace.</hi> Not only with Grace habitual, but with excited and actual; the Muſical Inſtrument delights not but when it is plaid upon.

            <p n="8">8. And what <hi>Davenant</hi> ſuggeſts, is very pertinent here; In ſinging of Pſalms, our principal care muſt be of our Hearts, and to follow the Wiſe man's counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.23. <hi>to keep our Hearts with all diligence.</hi> And this Learned man gives us a good reaſon; <hi>For they who neglect their Hearts, may pleaſe men with the artificial ſuavity of their Voice; but they will diſpleaſe God with the odious Impurity of their Hearts.</hi> And we muſt watch our Hearts; for vain and ſinful Thoughts will fly-blow this Duty as well as others. <hi>Gorran</hi> well obſerves, There are four Conditions of right Singing: There muſt be, 1. The Alacrity of the Voice. 2. The Conformity of the Work. 3. The Attention of the Heart. 4. A Rectitude towards God. And holy <hi>Bernard</hi> draws up an Indictment a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Offenders in this kind: <hi>Thou ſingeſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to pleaſe the people more than God; thou breakeſt thy voice muſically, break thy Will morally; thou keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt a Conſonancy in thy Voice, keep a Concord and Harm my in thy Manners.</hi> A holy <hi>heart</hi> and <hi>life</hi> make them that <hi>ſing</hi> to <hi>chant melodiouſly.</hi> Firſt <hi>purifie,</hi> then thou wilt <hi>tune</hi> thy Heart.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Neglect not <hi>Preparatory Prayer.</hi> Prayer prepares for <hi>ſinging</hi> as well as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Ordinances.

            <p n="2">2.

Thus <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51.13. We may truly be Satyriſts in this very Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; When we ſing a Pſalms of <hi>Judgment,</hi> we may <hi>awaken ſinners;</hi> and when we ſing Pſalms of <hi>Mercy</hi> and loving-kindneſs, we may <hi>incourage Saints.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Pſalms are ſung for <hi>Praiſe and Thanksgiving.</hi> Then as the Pſalmiſt ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.8. <hi>We awake our Glory,</hi> which Interpreters call the <hi>Tongue,</hi> an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent inſtrument for praiſing God. Singing of Pſalms is only the <hi>Eccho of Praiſe,</hi> the rebound of a joyous heart in a laudatory Speech; Praiſe loudly and Muſically proclaim'd, that men may hear our Thankſgivings, and bear teſtimony to our gratulatory enlargements; as the paſſenger bears witneſs to the Muſick of a Grove; there the pleaſant birds ſit and ſing.</p>
            <p>Now do ſuch conſider the rare effects of this Duty, <hi>viz.</hi> of ſinging to the Lord: and they are,</p>
            <p n="1">1.

               </note> 
               <hi>Acts</hi> 16.25. As prayer can ſhed a perfume, ſo ſinging can caſt a delight on the moſt diſplicent dungeon; this truly Divine Service can turn a priſon into a paradiſe; a place of reſtraint into the glorious liberty of the Sons of God. As <hi>Cyprian</hi> uſed to triumph; <hi>Our Conventions ſing our Pſalms.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Singing can <hi>prepare us for ſufferings.</hi> When Chriſt was ready to be offered up, he ſang an Hymn with his Diſciples; Chriſt ſups, and ſings, then dyes. Joy in the Lord (whereof ſinging is only the rebound) arms againſt the dint of ſuffering. It is a good ſaying of Chryſoſtome, <hi>Hoc genus delectationis,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>This kind of delight is moſt natural to the Soul; God appointed Pſalms, that from thence profit and pleaſure may flow together.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Singing raiſes the heart above the diſcouragement of ſuffering; nor can we ſo well muſe upon our pains, while we are ſo ſedulouſly tuning our prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="187" facs="tcp:95740:97"/>3. Singing lightens and <hi>exhilarates the Soul.</hi> We may ſay of this duty, as <hi>Tremelius</hi> ſpeaks of <hi>David</hi>'s harp, that by the Muſick of it, the ſtorms of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Spirit were allayed, and he was compoſed and ſerene; Singing both re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veals and amplifies our joy; It is not only a diſcovery, but an improvement,<note place="margin">Pſalmis nos ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectemus, &amp; ex hiſce hilarita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem noſtram promanare an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>notandum eſt.</note> As a learned man well takes notice, <hi>Let us delight our ſelves in ſinging Pſalms, and from them let us draw our Chearfulneſs and Delight.</hi> Let all our ſweet Waters guſh from this ſpring.</p>
            <p>Nor do ſuch conſider the ſweet allurements, which draw us to this duty; And if we inquire what it is that puts us upon rejoycing in God <hi>by Singing.</hi> —I ſhall tell you;</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Good Spirit. That Heavenly principle both leads us to this duty and helps us in it: this is one of the good motions of the bleſſed Spirit to put us upon ſinging the praiſes of the Lord. Wine tempts us to vain and wanton Songs, but the Spirit excites us to Holy and Heavenly Hymns; the Spirit firſt ſets the Tune, and Chriſt is the burden of the Song.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The joyous heart. Holy Singing is both the Sign and Vent of joy. The little Child is pained, and then it cries; the Saint is ſurprized with joy, and then it breaks out into ſinging. Smothers will turn into Flames; and the heart overcharged with complacency, will diſcharge it ſelf in this Holy Exultation. In the Churches triumph recorded by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> Iſa. 35.2. Singing follows joy as its proper and genuine product and birth.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A ſence of Obedience. To ſing praiſes to the Lord is a duty, which the Saints know not how to wave or reſpite. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> joyns praying and ſinging together, <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13. and the Believer knows not how to neglect the one no more than the other. Sometimes God calls us to the Croſs, and then we muſt be calm and patient; and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he calls us to the Quire, and then we muſt be pleaſant and delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.</p>
            <p>This checks thoſe <hi>who ſcruple this Ordinance;</hi> ſurely this muſt proceed <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> from the Evil one, turning himſelf into an Angel of Light. It was a ſerious moan which ſometimes many Miniſters in <hi>New England</hi> made, even in this Caſe; <hi>The ſinging of Pſalms,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>though it breath forth nothing but Heavenly harmony, and ſweet melody, yet ſuch is the ſubtilty of the Enemy, and the Enmity of our Nature againſt God, and the ways of God, that our hearts can find matter of diſcord in this Harmony, and Crotchets of diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this holy Melody.</hi> And hence ariſe ſo many queſtions about ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalms. — But I ſhall only touch upon three Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
            <p>How can a ſerious Chriſtian ſing in a mixed Congregation? The preſence <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Object. </seg>1</label> of the wicked will ſurely jar the Muſick, and give a very juſt Occaſion of Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence.</p>
            <p>Many who forbear ſinging in the Congregation, will not forbear it in their <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> families: And is there no <hi>Cham,</hi> no <hi>Judas,</hi> no withered branch? Are all the Son<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of <hi>Zion?</hi> Are all the Friends of the Bride-Chamber? This is not an uſual Happineſs.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:95740:98"/>2. And are there not mixtures when we pray, and when we hear? and this ſcruple may be levelled againſt theſe as well as againſt ſinging. There is as much purity, and ſo ought to be in Petitioners and Hearers as in Singers. And why then are we not as curious in theſe duties as in Singing? which if we were, few would join with us in theſe ſolemn approaches. Let us not (Dear Chriſtians) conſult fanſy, but reaſon and Scripture-proof.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Singing may be ſanctified for Conviction of ſinners; <hi>Moſes</hi> penned a Song, and God commands the people to ſing it, <hi>Deut.</hi> 31.30. And this Song was to convince the ſinful <hi>Iſraelites</hi> of their obſtinacy and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And if we are thus ſhy and ſcrupulous, with whom at laſt ſhall we join? Our Saviour himſelf had but 12 Apoſtles, and there was a <hi>Judas</hi> among them; what Conſtellation ſhall we aim at, where there is no blazing Comet or fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Star? Let us at laſt avoid that Language, ſtand further off I am holier than thee. It was but a Phariſaical boaſt to ſay, <hi>I am not as this Publican,</hi> Luke 18.11.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If ſinging be a duty, (as moſt certainly it is) thou art bound to perform it in the beſt manner thou canſt, and then others preſence will not enfeeble thy comfort, nor invalidate thy ſervice, thou ſhalt have peace in thy own Soul. Heatheniſh ſpectators (for ſo are wicked men at an Ordinance) did not eclipſe the glory of the Martyrs; their ſtakes were hung with Laurel notwithſtanding. — But it is Obſerved by a Worthy and Learned man, That all theſe Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ariſe from the Ignorance of the Nature, Uſe and Ends of this Bleſſed Duty.</p>

The Pſalms are a Chriſtian's choyceſt Oracle to fly to in times of diſtreſs; And was not the holy Pſalmiſt guided by an infallible Spirit? How often are the Pſalms quoted by Chriſt? <hi>Luke</hi> 20.42. &amp; ch. 24.44. and ſo by the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.20. as Divine Authority to eſtabliſh Truth. Let us therefore not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb our ſelves with theſe groundleſs Objections, but let us purſue and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace this Holy duty, which is the very Suburbs of Heaven; and let us ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve what a reverend perſon notes upon this Occaſion; <hi>I obſerve,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they never thrive well who neglect or ſcruple ſinging of Pſalms; they commonly begin at this Omiſſion, but they do not end there, but at laſt they come to be above all Ordinances, and ſo indeed without them, whoſe ſad condition is not ſufficiently to be deplored.</hi> And another Learned and Reverend Divine yet living, hath obſerved fatal and judicial proceedings of God againſt thoſe who have turned their backs upon this joyous and ſweet Ordinance; but let the Lord lead us into all underſtanding: the wiſe Chriſtian will pauſe and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>3</label> this is an evil much to be deplored in our times. We may now walk in the ſtreets on God's Holy day, and not hear the leaſt noiſe of a Pſalm, or ſound of a ſpiritual Song. It was, not long ſince, the wont of the Puritans, which were the moſt pretious Chriſtians, to Eccho forth the praiſes of the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> in this Duty, eſpecially upon the Lord's Day: Then was there a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Quire in their houſes; their Children were the little birds to ſing the praiſes of the Creator; the Servants likewiſe joining in the harmony to make up a fuller Muſick. But alas! Now the voice of the Bride, ſinging to her Beloved, is not heard in the places of our abode; there is ſilence inſtead of ſinging, and prating inſtead of praiſing, frivolous diſcourſes inſtead of joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous praiſes. It might behove us to ponder, how much of Heaven do we loſe in neglecting this Service? In ſinging Pſalms we begin the work of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. In Heaven we read of the Song of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the <hi>Lamb, Rev.</hi> 15.3. And of a <hi>new Song, Rev.</hi> 14.3. And the Angels though they have not Tongues, yet they have voices to ſing the praiſes of the Moſt High; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that this Heavenly ſervice is ſo neglected and unexerciſed <hi>is a lamentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſhall be for a Lamentation,</hi> Ezek. 19.14.</p>

Bernard</hi> makes two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions of grateful ſinging. 1. <hi>We muſt ſing purely, minding what we ſing, nor muſt we act or think any thing beſides; there muſt be no vain or vagrant thoughts; no diſſonancy between the Mind and the Tongue.</hi> 2. <hi>We muſt ſing ſtrenuouſly, not idly, not ſleepily or perfunctorily; we muſt ſing</hi> ex animo, <hi>moſt hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily and Energetically.</hi>

This was for the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, the Confirmation of the Goſpel, and to authorize them as Special Meſſengers ſent by <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At the ſight of this <hi>Miracle</hi> ſome wonder, others mock, as if this ſpeaking with <hi>divers Tongues</hi> had been a confuſed jabbering, that proceeded from the <hi>fumes</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> rather than the <hi>gift</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> of the <hi>Holy Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſatisfie both, <hi>Peter</hi> declares in a Sermon the <hi>effect</hi> and <hi>intent</hi> of the <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle;</hi> proving Jeſus, whom they had <hi>Crucified,</hi> to be Lord and Chriſt. When they heard this, many of the moſt <hi>obſtinate</hi> among them were <hi>pricked at the heart,</hi> and <hi>relented.</hi> An happy Sermon it was that <hi>Peter</hi> preached: it brought in thouſands of Souls to Chriſt; the firſt hanſel of the <hi>power</hi> of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and <hi>ſucceſs</hi> of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis good to obſerve what courſe they took for <hi>eaſe</hi> and <hi>relief,</hi> after this piercing and brokenneſs of heart; they ſaid to <hi>Peter</hi> and the reſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>Men and Brethren, what ſhall we do?</hi> This is the uſual Queſtion of men un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſound and thorow Conviction.</p>
            <p>To their ſerious Queſtion <hi>Peter</hi> makes a ſeaſonable Anſwer, <hi>v.</hi> 38. 'Tis the part of a good Phyſician, not only to diſcover the Diſeaſe, but alſo to preſcribe a Remedy; eſpecially ſhould ſpiritual Phyſicians be tender of broken-hearted Sinners, and willing and ready to give them Counſel.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Peter's</hi> Direction and Counſel to them obſerve firſt, What he perſwades them to do. Secondly, By what Motive and Argument; what they ſhould do, and what they ſhould receive.</p>
            <p>In the Advice he perſwades them to Repentance, and to be Baptized in the Name of Chriſt: The latter we are upon.</p>
            <p>For Explaining it, we may enquire,</p>
            <p>Firſt, Why is Baptiſm mentioned rather than Faith, and other things more internal and neceſſary to Salvation?</p>
            <pb n="192" facs="tcp:95740:100"/>
            <p>I anſwer, Certainly Faith is implied; for <hi>Mark</hi> 16.16. <hi>He that Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth, and is Baptized, ſhall be Saved.</hi> Baptiſm is an open and real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſt Crucified: So that <hi>Be Baptized in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> is as much as <hi>Be Baptized, Believing on the Name of the Lord Jeſus, for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Secondly, Baptiſm is mentioned becauſe it was the viſible Rite of receiving Proſelytes to Chriſt. Now it imported them who were <hi>convinced</hi> as Perſecutors to <hi>turn</hi> Profeſſors, if they would have eaſe for their Conſciences; and therefore not only to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve with the Heart, but to make open Profeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. Why in the Name of Chriſt only? the Father and the Holy Ghoſt is not mentioned according to the Preſcript-form, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. I anſwer, he ſpeaks not of the Form of Baptiſm, but the uſe and end thereof. Now the great uſe of Baptiſm is, that we may have benefit by the Myſtery of Redemption by Chriſt, therefore elſewhere we are ſaid to be Baptized into Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.3. <hi>And to put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. <hi>He is the Head of the Church, and by Baptiſm we are planted into his Myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Body.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This being premiſed, my work ſhall be to ſhew, what uſe and reſpect Baptiſm has unto this benefit of obtaining remiſſion of Sins by Jeſus Chriſt. I ſhall do it in theſe conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, that God hath ever delighted to deal with his Creatures in the way of a Covenant, that we might know what to expect from him, and might look upon our ſelves as under the firmer Bonds of obedience to his bleſſed Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty. In a Covenant which is the moſt ſolemn tranſaction between Man and Man, both parties are engaged, God to us, and we to God: It is not meet that one party ſhould be bound, and the other free; therefore both are bound to each other, God to Bleſs, and we to Obey. Indeed in the firſt Covenant the <hi>debitum poenae</hi> is only mentioned, becauſe that only took place, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely dye.</hi> But the other part is implied, and it doth in effect ſpeak thus much, <hi>Do and Live, Sin and Dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, becauſe the firſt Covenant was broken on our part, God was pleaſed to enter into a ſecond, wherein he would manifeſt the glory of his Redeeming grace, and pardoning Mercy to fallen Man; this was brought about in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.19. <hi>God was in Chriſt reconciling the world to himſelf,</hi> and therefore this ſecond Covenant is called a Covenant of Peace, as being made with us after the breach, and when Man was obnoxious to the wrath of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.10. <hi>The Covenant of my Peace ſhall not be remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</hi> Man needeth ſuch a Covenant, and God appeaſed by Chriſt offereth it to us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, In this Covenant of Peace, the Priviledges and Duties are ſuited to the State in which man was, when God invited him into Covenant with himſelf. Man was fallen from his Duty, and obnoxious to the wrath and diſpleaſure of God, and therefore the new Covenant is a Doctrine of Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins. What is <hi>Preach the Goſpel to every Creature,</hi> Mark 16.16. is in <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.47. <hi>That Repentance
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:95740:100"/> and Remiſſion of ſins ſhould be Preached in his Name among all Nations;</hi> for that is the Goſpel, or the new Remedial Law of our Lord Jeſus; Repentance to heal us and ſet us in joint again, as to our Duty: Remiſſion of Sins, to recover us in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God's favour; both theſe benefits we have by the Redeemer, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. Him hath God exalted to give Repentance and Remiſſion of Sins to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> he giveth the one ſimply, and both giveth and requireth the other; ſo that by the New Covenant, Remiſſion of Sins is conveyed to all true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, More diſtinctly to underſtand the tenour of this New and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Covenant, we muſt conſider both the Duties and the Priviledges there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; for in every Covenant there is <hi>ratio dati &amp; accepti,</hi> there is ſomething promiſed and given, and ſomething required; and uſually the Promiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of ſomewhat which the Party is willing of, and the Duty or Condition required of that to which he is more backward and loath to ſubmit; ſo in the Covenant of Grace, in the Promiſe God reſpects man's want, in the Duty his own Honour. Every man would have pardon, and be ſaved from Hell, but God will have ſubjection; even corrupt Nature is not againſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Happineſs; theſe God makes uſe of to gain us to Holineſs. All men readily catch at Felicity, and would have Impunity, Peace, Comfort, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, but are unwilling to deny the Fleſh, to renounce the credit, profit, or pleaſure of Sin; or to grow dead to the World and worldly things. Now God promiſeth what we deſire, on condition that we will ſubmit to thoſe things that we are againſt; as we ſweeten bitter Pills to Children, that they may ſwallow them the better; they love the Sugar, though they loath the Alloes; ſo doth God invite us to our Duty by our Intereſt. Therefore who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would enter into the Goſpel-ſtate, muſt reſolve to take the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings and Benefits offered for his Happineſs, and the Duties required for his Work. Indeed, accepting of the Benefits is a part of the Condition, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we treat with an inviſible God about a happineſs that lieth in another World; but 'tis but part, there are other terms, and therefore we muſt draw nigh with a true heart, <hi>in full aſſurance of Faith,</hi> Heb. 10.22. With a true heart, reſolving upon the Duties of the Covenant; in full aſſurance of Faith, depending upon God's Word, that he will give us the bleſſings.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The Priviledges are two, Pardon and Life; theſe are the great Bleſſings offered in the New Covenant; you have them both to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.18. <hi>To turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveneſs of ſins, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified by Faith.</hi> Theſe two Benefits are moſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, the one to allay the Fears of the guilty Creature, and the other to gratifie Deſires of Happineſs which are natural to us; the one to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy the miſery incurr'd by Sin and the Fall of Man, the other to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh our true and proper Felicity in the everlaſting enjoyment of God; the one to eaſe our Conſciences, and ſupport us againſt troubles of mind, the other to comfort us againſt the outward troubles and afflictions which ſin hath introduced into the World. In ſhort, the one to free us
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:95740:101"/> from deſerved Puniſhment, the other to aſſure us of undeſerved Bleſſedneſs; the one importeth Deliverance from Eternal Death, and the other Entrance into Eternal Life.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, The Duties thereof do either concern our firſt entrance into the Chriſtian ſtate, or our Progreſs therein. Our Lord repreſenteth it under the Notions of <hi>the Gate,</hi> and <hi>the Way,</hi> Mat. 7.14. <hi>Strait is the Gate, and narrow is the Way which leadeth into Life.</hi> Other Scriptures deliver it under the noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of making Covenant, and keeping Covenant with God: making Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.5. keeping Covenant, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.18. The Covenant muſt not only be made, but kept.</p>
            <p n="1">I. As to entring into Covenant with God, there is required true Repentance and Faith, <hi>Mark.</hi> 1.15. <hi>Repent, and believe the Goſpel.</hi> Repentance reſpects God as our end; Faith reſpects Chriſt as the great means, or way to the Father, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.21. <hi>Repentance towards God, and Faith in our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> God is our end, for Chriſt died to bring us to God; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. and Chriſt is our way, <hi>John</hi> 14.6. and whole Chriſtiany is a coming to God by Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. Now in our firſt entrance, Faith and Repentance are both mixt, and it is hard to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver them, and ſhow what belongs to the one, and what to the other; at leaſt it would perplex the Diſcourſe. Both together imply, that a man be turn'd from a life of Sin to God by Faith in Chriſt; or a renouncing the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and the Fleſh; and devoting and dedicating our ſelves to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Renouncing of the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh; for theſe are the three great Enemies of God and our Salvation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2, 3. <hi>In time paſt ye walked according to the Courſe of this World, after the Prince of the power of the Air, the Spirit that works now in the children of diſobedience, among whom al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo we had our converſation in the luſts of the fleſh, fulfilling the deſires of the fleſh and of the mind.</hi> There all our Enemies appear abreaſt: the Devil as the Grand deceiver and principal of all wickedneſs the World with its Pleaſures, Honours and Profits, as the Bait by which it doth deceive us, and ſteal away our hearts from God; and pervert and divert us, that we ſhould not look after the one thing neceſſary; the Fleſh is that Corrupt Inclination in us, which enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and cloſeth with theſe Temptations to the neglect of God, and the wrong of our own Souls; this is very importtnate to be pleaſed, and is the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal cauſe of all our miſchief, for <hi>James</hi> 1.14. <hi>Every man is inticed and drawn away by his own luſt.</hi> Theſe muſt be renounced before we can return to God, for till we put away our Idols, we cannot incline our hearts to the true God, <hi>Joſuah</hi> 24.23. <hi>And theſe are the great Idols by which our hearts are eſtranged from him.</hi> When God is laid aſide, ſelf interpoſeth as the next Heir, and that which we count ſelf is the fleſh. Many wrong their own Souls, but never any man hated his own fleſh. That which feeds the fleſh, is the World, and the Devil by propoſing the Bait, irritateth and ſtirreth up our affections. Therefore we muſt be turned from Satan to God; we muſt be delivered from the preſent evil World; we muſt abſtain from fleſhly Luſts, for God will have no Co-partners and Competitors in our hearts.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:95740:101"/>2. A devoting and giving up our ſelves to God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, as our God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.3. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. <hi>As our owner by Creation,</hi> Pſal. 100.3. <hi>And by Redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 6.19, 20. <hi>As our Soveraign Lord,</hi> Jer. 24.8. Iſa. 26.13. <hi>Other Lords beſides thee have had dominion over us, &amp;c.</hi> As the fountain of our life and bleſſedneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.14. <hi>I truſted in the Lord, I ſaid, thou art my God,</hi> Lam. 3.24. <hi>The Lord is my portion, ſaith my Soul, therefore will I hope in him,</hi> Pſal. 119.57. <hi>I have ſaid thou art my Potion, therefore I will keep thy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. As to our Progreſs and Perſeverance, which is our walking in the nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row way, and ſhews the ſincerity and heartineſs of our conſent in making the Covenant. And beſides, this is not the work of a Day, but of our whole Lives; we have continual need of coming to God by Chriſt. Here three things are required.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to the Enemies of God and our Souls, there muſt be a forſaking as well as a renouncing; the Devil muſt be forſaken, we muſt be no more of his party and confederacy; we muſt reſiſt, ſtand out againſt all his batteries and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaults, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8, 9. the World muſt be overcome, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.4, 5. and the fleſh muſt be ſubdued and mortified, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. that we be no more governed by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires thereof; and if we be ſometimes foiled, we muſt not go back again, but renew our Reſolutions; and the drift of our lives muſt ſtill be for God and Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to God, to whom we have devoted our ſelves, we muſt love and pleaſe and ſerve him all our days, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.75. we muſt make it our work to love him, and count it our happineſs to be beloved by him, and care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apply our ſelves to ſeek his favour, and cheriſh a freſh ſenſe of it upon our hearts, and continue with patience in well-doing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. till we come to the complete ſight and love of him in Heaven, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You muſt always live in the hope of the coming of Chriſt, and everlaſting glory, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.3. <hi>looking for the bleſſed hope;</hi> and <hi>Jude</hi> v. 21. <hi>looking for the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Lord Jeſus unto eternal life.</hi> As we did at firſt thankfully accept of our recovery by Chriſt, and at firſt conſent to renounce the Devil, the World, and the Fleſh, and reſolve to follow God's counſel and direction; we muſt ſtill perſevere in this mind, and uſe his appointed means in order to our final hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. The ſum then of our Chriſtianity is, that we ſhould by true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Faith, forſake the World, the Fleſh, and the Devil, and give up our ſelves to God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, that he may take us for his recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled Children, and for Chriſt's ſake forgive all our ſins; and by his Spirit give us grace to perſevere in thoſe Reſolutions, till our full and final happineſs come in hand.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, This Covenant, conſiſting of ſuch Duties and Priviledges, God hath confirmed by certain viſible Ordinances, commonly called Sacraments, as Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper; both which, but in a different manner, reſpect the whole tenour of the Covenant: For as the Covenant bindeth mutually on God's part and ours, ſo theſe Duties have a mutual Aſpect or Reſpect to what God does, and what we muſt do: on God's part they are a Sign and a Seal: on our part they are a Badge and a
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:95740:102"/> Bond. 1. On God's part they are ſealing or confirming Signs; as Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion is called <hi>a ſign or ſeal of the righteouſneſs which is by faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. that is, of the grace offered to us in Chriſt; ſo is Baptiſm, which came in the Room of Circumciſion, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>In whom ye are circumciſed, buried with him in Baptiſm.</hi> Surely the Goſpel-Ordinances ſignifie as much grace as the Ordinances of the legal Covenant; if Circumciſion was a Sign and Seal of the Righteouſneſs which is by Faith, a or pledge of God's good will to us in Chriſt, ſo is Baptiſm, ſo is the Lord's Supper; they are a Sign to ſignifie, and a Seal to confirm; to repreſent the Grace, and aſſure the grant of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and Life. As for inſtance, Baptiſm ſignifies Pardon and Life, ſo does the Lord's Supper, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.28, 29. That for our growth and nouriſhment, this for our imitation. Baptiſm is under our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration at preſent; that it hath reſpect to remiſſion of Sins, the Text is clear for it, and ſo are many other Scriptures. It was <hi>Ananias</hi> his Advice to <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 22.16. <hi>Ariſe and be Baptized, and waſh away thy ſins, and call on the Name of the Lord.</hi> So Epheſ. 5.26. <hi>That he might ſanctifie and cleanſe us by the waſhing of water through the Word.</hi> The waſhing repreſents the waſhing away the guilt and filth of ſin; it ſignifies alſo our Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to a bleſſed and eternal Life: Baptiſm ſaveth by the Reſurrection of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. Well then, it is a ſealing Sign. When God promiſed longer life to <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.8. he ſaid, <hi>What ſhall he the ſign that the Lord will heal me?</hi> So when he promiſeth pardon and life to us, What ſhall be the ſign that the Lord will do this for us? Baptiſm is this ſign; a witneſs between us and God, <hi>Gen.</hi> 31.48. <hi>This heap is a witneſs between thee and me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. On our part they are a Badge and a Bond to oblige us to the Duties of the Covenant: a Badge of the profeſſion, and a Bond to engage us to the Duties which that Profeſſion calls for. As the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſpeaks of Circumciſion, <hi>That whoſoever is circumciſed, is a debtor to the whole Law,</hi> Gal. 5.3. <hi>binds himſelf to the obſervances of</hi> Moſes. So a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian by being baptized becomes a Debtor, not to the Fleſh, <hi>to live after the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.12. And 'tis called an Anſwer towards God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. the anſwer ſuppoſes the demands of the Covenant, and ſo 'tis an under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking faithfully to perform the Conditions required of us; a Vow or an Obligation whereby we reckon our ſelves bound to dye unto Sin, and to live unto Righteouſneſs, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.11. It bindeth us chiefly to the Duties that belong to our entrance, as the Lord's Supper doth more directly to the Duties which belong to our progreſs; it bindeth us to a true belief of the Goſpel, or an acceptance of Chriſt, and conſent to the Covenant of Grace; to renounce the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and the Fleſh, and to give up our ſelves unto God; and therefore the Baptiſmal Covenant, by which we are initiated into Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, is expreſt by our being Baptized in the Name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. which implies a giving up our ſelves to them in their diſtinct perſonal Relations: To the Father, that we may return to him, and obey him as our rightful Lord; that we may love him, and depend upon him, as the Fountain of all our good
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:95740:102"/> and all-ſufficient happineſs; and prefer his favour before all the ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the World. We are Baptized in the Name of Chriſt, that we may believe in him, accept him as our Saviour and Redeemer; expecting to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by his Merits, Righteouſneſs, and Interceſſion, from the Wrath of God, and Guilt of Sin and eternal Death. To the Holy Ghoſt as our Guide, Sanctifier, and Comforter; that he may free us from Sin, change us into the image and likeneſs of Chriſt, and lead us into all truth and godlineſs, and comfort us with the ſenſe of our preſent intereſt in God's love, and the hopes of future glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</p>
            <p>Eighthly, Theſe viſible confirming Ordinances give us great advantages a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Word and bare propoſal of the Covenant.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As theſe ſealing Signs are an expreſſion of God's earneſt and ſincere reſpect to our Salvation. God hath opened his mind in his Word concerning his love and good will to Sinners in Chriſt; and he hath alſo added his Seal, that the Charter of his Grace might be more valid and authentick. It argueth the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>communicativeneſs</hi> of God to give notice in his Word; but his <hi>ſolicitouſneſs</hi> and <hi>anxious care</hi> for our good, to give viſible aſſurance in the Sacraments, as being willing <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, over and above to ſatisfie the Heirs of Promiſe. If a man be more than ordinarily cautious to make all ſure, it is a ſign his heart is upon the thing. Surely 'tis a great condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God would diſpoſe his grace into a Covenant-form; but 'tis a further condeſcenſion that he would add Seals, which needed not on his part; but he added them to give us the more ſtrong conſolation. <hi>Nudum pactum,</hi> a naked Promiſe is not ſo valid and authentick, as when Articles of Agreement are put into a formal Inſtrument and Deed of Law, and that ſign'd and ſeal'd, and interchangeably delivered; this breeds more confidence and ſecurity on both ſides. God's Word certifieth us of his good will; but when he is pleaſed to make a formal Indenture of it, and to ſign it, and ſeal it, it doth breed more aſſurance in our minds, that his Promiſes are made with a real intent to perform them; and bindeth us the more firmly to God, when beſides our naked Promiſe, there is a kind of Vow and Oath on our part ſolemnly entered into by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is this Advantage in the Sacraments above the Word, that they are a cloſer Application. The Word ſpeaks to all promiſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uouſly, as inviting; the Sacraments to every one in particular, as obliging. By the Word none are excluded from the Grace offered upon God's terms, <hi>Go preach the Goſpel to every Creature;</hi> but by the Sacraments, every one is expreſly admoniſhed of his Duty. The Object revealed in the Word is like the Brazen Serpent, which without difference was expoſed to the Eye of all, <hi>that whoſoever looked upon it might be healed;</hi> but the ſame Object offered in the Sacraments is like the blood ſprinkled on the Door-poſts, <hi>that every man might be aſsured that his Family ſhould be in ſafety.</hi> Now the reaſon of this difference is, becauſe things propounded in the Word are like a Treaty between God and us; or an offer and a debating of matters till the parties do agree: But Sacraments are not of uſe till
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:95740:103"/> both ſides have agreed upon the Conditions of the Covenant. In Adults at leaſt the Word conduceth to the making of the Covenant, but Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſuppoſe it made; therefore the Word univerſally propoundeth that which in the Seals is particularly applied. Now thoſe things do not af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect us ſo much which are ſpoken indifferently to all, as thoſe that are particularly applied to our ſelves, becauſe they ſtir us up to a more accurate care and endeavour to fulfil the Duty incumbent upon us. The Conditions are propounded in the Word, <hi>Repent and believe, and I will pardon, and give thee eternal life:</hi> But the Sacraments ſuppoſe an Actual conſent, that thou haſt done, or undertaken ſo to do; and then God comes and ſaith, <hi>Take this as an undoubted pledge, that thou ſhalt have what I have promiſed;</hi> which doth more encreaſe our Hope, and perſwade our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By theſe Sealing Signs we are ſolemnly inveſted into a right to the things promiſed, as when we are put in poſſeſſion of what we have bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gained for by due formalities of Law: <hi>This is my Body;</hi> that is our ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Inveſtiture into the Priviledges purchaſed by Chriſt's Crucified Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. A Believer receiveth Chriſt in the Word, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. and he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſt in the Lord's Supper. What's the difference? There his right is ſolemnly owned and confirmed in the way which God hath appointed. As ſoon as a man conſents to a Bargain, he hath an Intereſt in the thing bargained for, but the right is made more explicite when 'tis delivered to him by ſome formalities of Law, as an Houſe by a Key, a Field by a Turf or Twig; in ſuch delivery we ſay, This Key is my Houſe; this Turf or Twig is my Field. So are we put in poſſeſſion of Chriſt by theſe words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Every peninent and believing Sinner hath a right to Chriſt and Pardon, but his ſolemn Enfeoffment is by the Sacraments: <hi>Repent, and be Baptized every one of you for the Remiſſion of Sins;</hi> or as it is <hi>Acts</hi> 22.14. <hi>Ariſe and be Baptized for the waſhing away of thy Sins.</hi> God gave <hi>Abraham</hi> the Land of Promiſe by word of mouth; but <hi>Gen.</hi> 13. he bids him go through the Land and view it, and build an Altar, and offer Sacrifice there; then was he actually inveſted in the Gift. God gave <hi>Iſrael</hi> a grant of <hi>Canaan,</hi> but the Cluſters of <hi>Eſchol</hi> were as it were the Livery and Seiſin of it. Though the Gift be ſufficiently made over by the Promiſe, yet 'tis further ratified, and more ſolemnly conveyed and delivered by the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is one Advantage more, That the great Myſteries of godlineſs are laid before our Eyes in ſome viſible Rites, and ſo have greater force to excite the mind to ſerious Conſideration. When God will condeſcend to give us help againſt our Infirmities, it muſt be by the Senſes, by which all knowledg comes into the Soul: Now Feeling, Smelling, Taſting, ſeem not ſo fit for this; as being more groſs, and conducing to the welfare of the Body; but Seeing and Hearing convey Objects to the Underſtanding, and therefore are called the Senſes of Diſcipline and Learning. Now the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is made by words, which ſtrike the Ear; but the Seals by viſible things ſet it before our Eyes, and as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified among us, and evidently ſet forth, Gal.</hi> 3.1. The ſight doth in a
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:95740:103"/> more lively manner ſtir up the mind than the bare Hearing. Waſhing from Sin doth fitly repreſent to us, and raiſe thoughts in us about the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Spirit; and ſo in a lively manner excite us to expect this be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Let us not be ſlight in the uſe and improvement of Baptiſm; for it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>implieth a ſolemn covenanting with God, that we may obtain Remiſſion of Sins and eternal Life. <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt calleth it <hi>Mark</hi> 1.4. <hi>The Baptiſm of Repentance for the Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> Therefore let us reflect upon our ſelves; We are all Baptized, but what are we the better? have we the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the pardon of our Sins, and a greater ſenſe of our Covenant-Vow, to dye unto Sin, and live unto God? we cannot have the former without the latter; both muſt be regarded by us. <hi>Volateranus</hi> reporteth of <hi>Lucian,</hi> that ſcoffing Atheiſt, that when he revolted from the Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, he ſcoffed at his Baptiſm, ſaying, <hi>Se nihil ex eo conſecutum, quam quod nomen ipſius eſſet corruptum ex</hi> Lucio, Lucianus <hi>factum.</hi> That he got no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing by his Baptiſm but a ſyllable to his Name, it being changed from <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> to <hi>Lucianus.</hi> Alas! what do moſt get by their Baptiſm but a Name? It ſhould not be ſo with you; you may have great advantage by it, if you improve it to the ends for which it was appointed. To quicken you, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Baptiſm is a perpetual Bond upon us, obliging us to Repentance, and an holy life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. therefore the Scripture often reaſoneth from it, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.2. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to Sin live any longer therein?</hi> He argueth not <hi>ab impoſſibili,</hi> but <hi>ab incongruo;</hi> not from what is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but what will misbecome our renewed eſtate, which we profeſs to enter into by Baptiſm; which is a Vowed Death to Sin, and a Bond wherewith we bind our Souls to New Obedience. So elſewhere, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Ye are riſen with Chriſt,</hi> (in the import and ſignification of Baptiſm) <hi>therefore ſeek the things which are above.</hi> And again, <hi>Ye are dead, therefore mortifie,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>verſe</hi> 3, 5. Once more, <hi>verſe</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Put off all theſe, ſeeing ye have put off the old man with his deeds.</hi> And in many other places the Apoſtle argueth from the Baptiſmal Ingagement to the effect intended and ſignified there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Improvement of Baptiſm is the beſt Preparation for the Lord's Supper. <hi>John</hi> 13.8. <hi>If I waſh thee not, thou haſt no part with me.</hi> That waſhing had a ſpiritual meaning; and preſently after it the Sacrament of Chriſt's Body and Blood was inſtituted, to the participation of which this ſpiritual waſhing was neceſſary. In the Suppoſition, <hi>If I waſh thee not,</hi> is implied Baptiſm; in the Commination, <hi>thou haſt no part with me,</hi> is implied the Lord's Supper, which Chriſt was then about to inſtitute. <hi>In foro Eccleſiae,</hi> before the Church, none but Baptized Perſons have a right to the Lord's Table, <hi>in foro Coeli,</hi> before God: none but thoſe who have the fruit of Baptiſm have right to the benefits thereof; they that are ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the Spirit of Chriſt have only right to the Benefits purchaſed by his Blood. Our Lord would mind his Diſciples of this, before he would admit them to his Table.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:95740:104"/>3. If we improve it not, our Baptiſm will be a Witneſs to ſollicite Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance againſt us; as the Goſpel it ſelf is preached, <hi>either for a Witneſs to us,</hi> Matth. 24.14. or <hi>for a Witneſs againſt us,</hi> if we obey it not, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.9. So Baptiſm, inſtead of being a Witneſs to us, will be a Witneſs againſt us, if we mind it not, and in the Judgment we ſhall fare no better than the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; for all the difference between us is, that they are uncircumciſed in fleſh, and we in heart, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.25, 26. they are not waſhed in Water, and we are not cleanſed from our ſins. I remember a paſſage in <hi>Victor <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ticenſis</hi> concerning one <hi>Elpidophorus,</hi> who had revolted from Catholiciſm to the <hi>Vandal Arrians;</hi> the Deacon who had Baptized him, ſhewed him the Stole, or Linnen Clothes, in which he was Baptized, ſaying, <hi>Hae te accuſabunt cum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſtas venerit Judicantis,</hi> &amp;c. O <hi>Elpidophorus,</hi> theſe ſhall be a Witneſs againſt thee to all eternity for thy juſt perdition, when the Judge cometh: what wilt thou do, Wretch, when the people of God ſhall be admitted to the Joys of Heaven, and thy ſelf thruſt out? <hi>&amp;c.</hi> If we have been Baptized, and lived di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to our Baptiſmal Vow, as if we were in Covenant with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, the World, and the Fleſh, rather than with Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, what will become of us in the Judgment?</p>
            <p>But how ſhall we improve it?</p>
            <p>Firſt, We muſt perſonally and ſolemnly own the Covenant made with God in Infancy; every one of us ſhould chuſe the Lord for our <hi>Soveraign Lord</hi> and <hi>Portion;</hi> and Chriſt Jeſus for our <hi>Redeemer</hi> and <hi>Saviour;</hi> and the Holy Ghoſt for our <hi>Guide, Sanctifier,</hi> and <hi>Comforter.</hi> Every one muſt perſonally thus engage himſelf to God; 'tis not enough that Chriſt engage for us as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſurety of all the Elect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. Something he did for us, and in our Names, but every one muſt take a Bond upon himſelf, before he can have the benefit of it; You muſt yield up your ſelves to the Lord, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.8. 'Tis not enough that the Church ingage for us, as a viſible Political Body, or a Community and Society of men, who are in viſible Covenant with God and Chriſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.8. <hi>Thou entredſt into Covenant with me, and becameſt mine,</hi> meaning it of the Body of the Church; but every individual perſon muſt alſo enter into Covenant with God, and become his, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 20.37. <hi>I will cauſe you to paſs under the Rod, and I will bring you into the Bond of the Covenant:</hi> Where there is an Alluſion to the Sheeps paſſing out of the Fold, when they were to be Tithed for God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 27.32. they were to be told with a Rod, one, two, three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Tenth was the Lords. God will not covenant with us in the lump and body, but every one was to be particularly minded of his Duty: 'tis not enough that our Parents did engage for us in Baptiſm, as the <hi>Iſraelites in the Name of their little ones did avouch God to be their God,</hi> Dent. 29.10, 11, 12. No man can ſavingly tranſact this Work for another; we muſt ratifie the Covenant in our own Perſons, and make our <hi>own profeſſed ſubjection to the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> 2 Cor. 9.13. This Work can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be done by a Proxy or Aſſigns; our Parents Dedication will not profit us, without ſome perſonal Act of our own, if we live to years of diſcretion: Once more, this muſt be done not only in words, or viſible external Rites, which may ſignifie ſo much as perſonal Covenanting with God, but a Man muſt ingage his heart to God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 30.21. yea, this is a buſineſs that muſt be
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:95740:104"/> done between God and our own Souls, where no outward witneſſes are conſcious to it. God ſpeaketh to the Soul in this tranſaction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.3. <hi>Say unto my Soul, I am thy Salvation;</hi> and the Soul ſpeaketh to God, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.24. <hi>thou art my Portion, ſaith my ſoul;</hi> and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.2. <hi>O my ſoul, thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, thou art my God:</hi> thus the Covenant is carried on in Soul-Language. Now upon this Perſonal inward Covenanting with God our right to all the priviledges doth depend.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Renew often the ſenſe of your Obligation to God, and keep a conſtant reckoning how you lay out your ſelves for him, <hi>Acts</hi> 27.23. <hi>His I am, and him I ſerve,</hi> Phil. 1.21. <hi>To me to Live is Chriſt.</hi> Some few Renegado's <hi>renounce</hi> their Baptiſm, but moſt Chriſtians <hi>forget</hi> their Baptiſm, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is blind, and cannot ſee afar off, and has forgotten that he was waſhed from his old ſins;</hi> therefore we ſhould be continually exciting our ſelves both to obedience and dependence, that the ſincerity of our firſt Vow and Conſent may be verified by a real and conſtant performance of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You ſhould uſe frequent ſelf-reflection, that you may come to know whether you are indeed waſhed from the guilt and ſilth of ſin, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Such were ſome of you, but now ye are ſanctified, but now ye are juſtified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God.</hi> You ſhould obſerve what further ſenſe you have of the pardon of ſin, how you get ground upon your bondage of Spirit, and grow up into ſome rejoycing of Faith, for by theſe ſigns God intended <hi>our ſtrong conſolation,</hi> Heb. 6.18. And the Eunuch when he was Baptized, <hi>went his way rejoicing,</hi> Acts 8.39. Hath God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyed his Covenant to me? Taken me into the Family? Planted me into the Myſtical Body of Chriſt? and ſhall not I be glad and rejoyce in his Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? So for Sanctification, ſee whether <hi>God's Intereſt</hi> doth prevail in you, or the <hi>Intereſt of the Fleſh;</hi> what Power and ſtrength of Will you get againſt Corruption eaſily, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.16, 17. whether ſin be more ſubdued, and you can govern your Paſſions and Appetites better, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. They that are Chriſt's ſhould find ſomething of this in themſelves, otherwiſe their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm is but an empty formality.</p>
            <p>Fourthly and Laſtly, You muſt uſe it as a great help in all Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; as when you are tempted to ſin, either by the delights of Senſe: a Chriſtian hath his Anſwer ready, I am no Debtor to the Fleſh, or I am Baptized, and dedicated to God in the way of Mortification and Holineſs to obtain pardon and Life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.15. Shall I take the Members of Chriſt, &amp;c. this Soul, this Body, this Time, this Strength is Chriſts, not to pleaſe the Fleſh, but the Lord: Or by the terrors of Senſe. <hi>Dionyſia</hi> comforted her Son <hi>Majoricus,</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Martyr, when he was going to ſuffer for owning the God-head of Chriſt, with this Speech, <hi>Memento, Fili, Baptiza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum eſſe in nomine Patris, Filii, &amp; Spiritus Sancti,</hi> Remember, my Son, that thou art Baptized in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, and be conſtant. So when you are tempted by the Devil, taking advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:95740:105"/> of your Melancholy, and grievous afflictions, to queſtion God's Love and Mercy to Penitent Believers. Remember the Covenant Sealed in Baptiſm, that you may keep up your Faith in God through Chriſt, which pardoneth all your ſins, and hath begotten us to a lively hope. We muſt expect to be Tempted: the Devil tempted Chriſt after his Baptiſm to queſtion his filiation ſo ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly atteſted. <hi>Compare Mat.</hi> 3.17. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith of himſelf, that when the Devil tempted him to deſpair, or to any doubts and fears about the Love of God or his Mercy to Sinners, he would always Anſwer, <hi>Ecce ego Baptizatus ſum, &amp; credo in Chriſtum Crucifixum,</hi> Behold, I am Baptized and Believe in Chriſt Crucified. And he telleth us of an Holy Virgin, who gave this reply when the Devil abuſed her Solitudes, and injected any deſpairing thoughts into her mind, <hi>Baptizata ſum,</hi> I am Baptized, and entred into God's Covenant, and will expect the pardon of my ſins by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thus ſhould we all the daies of our Life improve our Baptiſm, till we have the full of that <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Happy</hi> eſtate, for which we were firſt purified and waſhed in God's Laver.</p>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>The Primitive Fathers,</hi> that trod on the Heels of the Apoſtles, and were moſt likely to be beſt acquainted with the Apoſtles practice, <hi>highly eſteemed this way of teaching, and conſtantly uſed it.

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Parentt cannot but love themſelves, their own peace, their own comforts, their own delights;</hi> and what more probable <hi>means</hi> to advance theſe than the pious <hi>education</hi> of their children? which fully appears by this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either their conſcientious endeavours prove ſucceſsful or not?</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>If the Lord pleaſe to ſmile on endeavours,</hi> into what a <hi>tranſport</hi> and <hi>extaſie</hi> of joy will it raiſe the ſerious Parent, to ſee the corruption of his Child's Nature heal'd, <hi>to ſee ſaving grace wrought in his heart.</hi> If ſuch a ſight be ſo pleaſing to Spiritual Fathers, to <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 2.10. to <hi>John:</hi>

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>When this grace is wrought in the hearts of children,</hi> and that eſpecially by their Parents, <hi>this cannot but inflame the hearts of children with deareſt love of, and ingage them to the higheſt duty to their Parents;</hi> they muſt of neceſſity be far more <hi>loving</hi> and <hi>dutiful</hi> than otherwiſe they could or would be. <hi>A wiſe Son maketh a glad Father:</hi> But how?<note place="margin">Prov. 15.20.</note> viz. <hi>by a dutiful and reſpectful carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>By this means Parents ſhall do unſpeakable good to their Families</hi> and <hi>Poſterity.</hi> Hereby even many Ages after they are dead, like <hi>Abel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Deut. 4.9.</note> they ſhall yet <hi>ſpeak,</hi> and Poſterity hearing the voice of their Anceſtors, coming as it were from the dead, they will be more apt to credit and believe. By pious Education the true Religion is <hi>kept up</hi> in the world, and <hi>propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> from Age to Age. The care of the <hi>two Tribes and an half</hi> of propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the true Religion to their Poſterity, is very notable in that famous Scripture, <hi>Joſh.</hi> 22.24, 25.

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:95740:111"/> this their Brethren the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> are highly offended, but received full ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when they were aſſured <hi>that this was done for the ſake of Poſterity, leſt they ſhould be made to ceaſe from fearing the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Parents have many and great advantages above all others, for the ſucceſsful inſtructing and educating of their children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Children are more confident of their Parents love than any others.</hi> Whether Miniſters and ſtrangers ſpeak to them in <hi>love,</hi> they are uncertain, but of their Parents <hi>love</hi> they are well aſſured. Now nothing takes ſo much with any one, as that which is believed to proceed from love, ſpecially by one that loves. This inſtruction, <hi>ſaith the loving Child,</hi> comes not only from my dear Father's <hi>lip</hi> or <hi>head,</hi> but from his affectionate <hi>heart;</hi> and therefore I will readily receive it, and lodg it in my own.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Parents have their children in hand betimes, before they are fly-blown with any falſe Opinions, or leven'd with bad impreſſions;</hi> before they have any other ſin than that which was born with them. Parents therefore have an <hi>opportunity</hi> of making the <hi>firſt</hi> impreſſions on them, even while they are moſt <hi>docile, tender, flexible,</hi> and leaſt apt to make reſiſtance againſt <hi>inſtruction.</hi> But now when they come to their Miniſter, Inſtructer, Tutor, they are <hi>as a Paper Printed before,</hi> and therefore unapt to receive another Impreſſion. They have much to be untaught before they can be taught: fraught with <hi>ſelf conceitedneſs</hi> and <hi>proud objections,</hi> more apt to ſtrive againſt and reſiſt Inſtruction, than humbly and readily to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. To wind up this Argument on the cloſeſt Bottom. <hi>Children wholly depend on Parents for their preſent maintenance and their future Portions,</hi> and they know 'tis their <hi>intereſt</hi> to hearken and obey. Parents <hi>Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> over their Children is moſt unqueſtionable. They dare not open their mouths againſt it, as they will adventure to do againſt Miniſters. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents have the Power of the Rod to back Inſtruction, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.15. They beſt know the peculiar <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>temperatures</hi> of their Children, and ſo beſt know how to chuſe and apply the moſt proper Remedy. Parents are neareſt their Children, and can beſt diſcern all their faults in time; and have opportunity of ſpeaking to them in the moſt <hi>familiar</hi> manner, that may beſt be underſtood, and after this to <hi>inculcate</hi> their Inſtructions, and drive them home, that what is not done at <hi>one</hi> time may be done at <hi>ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By all theſe <hi>advantages</hi> it appears that God hath furniſhed Parents above all others, to be <hi>Inſtruments</hi> of their Childrens good, and the firſt and greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of their Salvation.</p>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Parents ſtand obliged to their Children by more and ſtronger Bonds than any Paſtor can be to his Flock,</hi> Bonds of <hi>Nature,</hi> as well as <hi>Grace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Parents have more means and opportunities to prevail with their Children, than any Paſtor living can have to do good on his Flock.</hi> What a ſurpaſſing In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt have <hi>Parents</hi> in the <hi>eſteem, love, affection</hi> of their Children!

What an <hi>awful Authority over them!</hi> What <hi>ſtrict Obligations</hi> upon them, which no Miniſter can ſo much as pretend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The truth is, none upon Earth have ſuch fair <hi>opportunities</hi> to inſtruct and bring others to goodneſs, as <hi>Parents</hi> have. This was that that holy <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiah</hi> meant in his Prayer, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.18, 19.

Alaſs, <hi>they do not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand what they ſay.</hi> They do but Act the <hi>Parot,</hi> know not what it is they do repeat, and ſo, whileſt we pretend to advance the fear and ſervice, we do but make our Children to <hi>profane</hi> the Name of God, <hi>or to take it in vain.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Joh. 16.16, 17, 18.</note> May we therefore <hi>ſay,</hi> that by reaſon of their Ignorance they took that Name of God, his Word, <hi>in vain?

            <p n="1">1.

Thus <hi>Paul</hi> accoſts the <hi>Romans, I long to ſee you, that I may impart unto you ſome ſpiritual gift,</hi> Rom. 1.10, 11.

            <p>In the words you have <hi>four parts,</hi> two of which are expreſſed, and the other two implied.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. A duty; <hi>this do.</hi>
               </item>

               <item>3. The Obligation to the duty, <hi>Chriſt's command,</hi> this is implied.</item>
               <item>4. The perſons under the Obligation: the whole Church Catholick mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, ſo far as they are Scripturally capacitated thereto; this likewiſe is implied.</item>
            </list>
            <p>But of theſe in their order.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The duty; <hi>this do.</hi> What is this to be done? the Apoſtle tells you in the beginng of this verſe, and in the following verſe: and it is this. <hi>This broken bread take and eat, This Cup take and drink.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a Duty, my brethren, ſo plain, ſo eaſie, of whoſe obſcurity or difficulty certainly we have no cauſe to complain.</p>
            <p>For what can be leſs obſcure than a <hi>command</hi> ſo evidently expreſſed, and what more eaſie than to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> and call to mind the greateſt and beſt of friends that <hi>loved us and waſhed us from our ſins in his own blood?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 1.5.</note> and ſurely then a neglect herein muſt needs prove a <hi>ſin that will admit of no excuſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if any of you be offended at the outward meanneſs of the Ordinance
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:95740:121"/> and be thereby tempted to neglect the obſervance; I wiſh you to remember, who they were that ſtumbled at Chriſt himſelf becauſe of the poverty of his Parents, <hi>is not this</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Carpenter's Son?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13.55.</note> This was the introduction to their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting of Chriſt, and to that great plague that followed, <hi>viz.</hi> their being rejected of Chriſt. Certainly as the meanneſs of his Parents ought not to have prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the glory of his perſon to thoſe infidels: ſo ought not the ſeeming poverty of theſe elements of bread and wine any waies abate of the glory of that <hi>myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of our Redemption</hi> that is ſhadowed out by them. I know our carnal reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are apt to ſuggeſt, that ſince Chriſt intended to leave behind him a monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the greatneſs of his perſon, and of his gracious undertaking in redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Church to himſelf by his blood, that it would have been more ſuitable to the honour of ſuch an undertaking, if the monument had been more magnifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; as if he had given in charge to his <hi>Diſciples</hi> to have erected his Statue of beaten gold, and ſet it up in the places of their <hi>ſolemn Aſſemblies,</hi> as the <hi>Roman Senate</hi> uſed to do for the honour of their excellent men, whoſe Statues they erected In their <hi>Capitols;</hi> or as the <hi>London Senate</hi> doth in honour of their Kings, they give them their Statues in their <hi>Royal Exchange.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To this I ſay, that certainly Chriſt is wiſer than man, and that this memorial of himſelf, which is already appointed by him, is more ſutable to the end inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, than what our vain thoughts have or can propoſe. For to what end ſhould he have cauſed ſuch golden ſtatues to have been erected to his memory, when he was ſo acquainted with the nature of man, and with his propenſities to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, and therefore could not but foreſee, that at leaſt they would probably make no better uſe of them, than the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did of the <hi>Brazen Serpent,</hi> to whom they moſt unworthily paid that honour that was only due to God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And that this is no vain conjecture, I only deſire you to call to mind, that, though the wiſdom of our Saviour pitched upon bread and wine, that of all things ſeem moſt unfit to make Idols of, yet what bad uſe men have made thereof; and how fooliſhly their vain minds have tranſubſtantiated them into God, I need not tell thoſe that know there are Papiſts in the World, and have heard of their Idolatrous doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
            <p>But peradventure ſome may yet further urge, that ſince it pleaſed our Saviour to <hi>chuſe,</hi> to <hi>appoint</hi> a feaſt for his <hi>remembrance,</hi> it had been meet this feaſt ſhould have been more magnificent, and conſequently more ſignificant of the Majeſty and riches of that Lord, whoſe Table it is; but to have only a piece of broken bread &amp; a cup of wine, what poor man could have made a <hi>meaner entertainment?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This alſo is eaſily anſwered, I ſay therefore, that ſuch a pompous feaſt you talk of had not ſo well comported with his principal end in the inſtitution: for Chriſt did not in this Supper intend the filling of your bellies, but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing of your ſouls: it was not inſtituted for that end as the Feaſt of firſt-fruits among the Jews, for the remembrance of God's bleſſing of the earth and giving them full harveſts, but for the remembrance of things of a higher na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, of things inviſible, ſpiritual and eternal, as the ſaving you from ſin, the law, from the grave and hell, which were all procured by the breaking of Chriſt's body, and the pouring out his blood for you; now your magnificent feaſts were not ſo fitted for ſuch a Commemoration, for they rather would have tended to have clog'd your ſpirits, made them dull and ſtupid, and far leſs apt
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:95740:121"/> to have <hi>contemplated</hi> ſuch <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Heavenly</hi> things as thoſe now named are: And therefore that this Supper is ſo mean as it is, it is far better, than if it were ſo great and royal as you conceive.</p>
            <p>There are others are well enough ſatisfied with the wiſdom of their Lord, and in the nature of the things appointed for the <hi>remembrance of him,</hi> which yet may be, and ought to be inquiſitive as to the reaſon of them;</p>
            <p>Which I ſhall reduce to theſe 4 <hi>Queſtions.</hi>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Why did the Lord appoint bread rather than any other kind of food?</item>
               <item>2. Why muſt it be broken bread?</item>
               <item>3. Why muſt it be taken and eaten?</item>
               <item>4. Why wine as well as bread? and why Wine rather than any other drink?</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. To the firſt I ſay, he appointed <hi>bread</hi> as moſt apt to <hi>ſignifie</hi> the thing there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to be <hi>preſented to our Faith,</hi> and that is himſelf, as he is <hi>bread of life</hi> to our Souls, for ſo he calleth himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.33. <hi>The bread of God is he which cometh down from Heaven, and giveth life unto the world.</hi> And 35. <hi>Jeſus ſaid, I am the bread of life, he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger.</hi> This is evident that man's <hi>natural life</hi> doth not more depend on the vertue of the bread that periſheth, than the Soul's life of <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> depends on that <hi>vertue</hi> that proceedeth from a ſuffering Jeſus; <hi>I live</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul) yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> all that life of Faith, all the indwellings of Grace in our hearts, comes from, and is maintained by the vertues and influences of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> this <hi>bread of life:</hi> and ſo likewiſe doth our <hi>eternal life</hi> depend on him, as he likewiſe tells us, <hi>v.</hi> 27. <hi>Labour for the meat that endureth to eternal life, which the Son of man ſhall give you:</hi> this meat is the Lord himſelf, who by his ſufferings made our peace, and purchaſed the life of grace and glory for us.</p>
            <p>And indeed no other meat, as bread, could ſo aptly ſet forth this Myſtery; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no food is ſo ſuitable to <hi>man's nature,</hi> none for a conſtancy ſo pleaſant, none ſo ſtrengthning; a man can better ſubſiſt with bread without other meats, than with any other meats without bread: thereby the <hi>Myſtery</hi> of conveighing Soul-l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>fe to the ſinner is excellently ſet forth; for as there is <hi>other</hi> meat for the body beſides bread, ſo there is another way of <hi>giving life</hi> to the Soul beſides that of a Saviour, and that is an <hi>exact obedience to the Law of God;</hi> but alas! the ſinner through the <hi>weakneſs of the fleſh</hi> can never digeſt that <hi>ſtrong meat,</hi> and ſo cannot live by it: But for a poor, weak, infirm ſinner to be maintained in a <hi>life of grace</hi> and <hi>acceptance</hi> with an <hi>offended God</hi> in and by a <hi>Saviour,</hi> is a way of living ſo ſuitable to a <hi>ſinner,</hi> that Men and Angels could never have thought of one ſo ſuitable; and therefore nothing, as bread, was ſo fit to ſet forth this Myſtery.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But why muſt it be broken bread? Chriſt himſelf acquaints us with the myſtical reaſon thereof in the verſe of the Text, it is to ſet forth the breaking of the body of Chriſt; by breaking his body muſt be taken to comprehend all the ſufferings of his Humane nature as united with the Divine, as all his ſoul-ſufferings, (of which there are 3 Phraſes uſed by the Evangeliſts very empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically, as <gap reason="foreign">

Upon <hi>this account</hi> it is that the bread of this <hi>Supper</hi> muſt be broken before it be taken and eaten, the <hi>broken bread</hi> that is the <hi>ſign,</hi> and <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings</hi> that is the <hi>myſtery</hi> ſignified by it, as I have ſhewed.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Why muſt this broken bread be taken and eaten? This is not without its <hi>Myſtery,</hi> for thereby is meant that theſe <hi>Breakings, Bruiſings, Woundings</hi> of Chriſt's Soul and Body, was not for any <hi>ſin of his own,</hi> for he was a <hi>lamb without ſpot;</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.19.</note> but it was for our ſins and for our benefit. Our dear Jeſus ſows in tears, and we reap the harveſt of his tears in joy; he by the <hi>meritorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction</hi> of his <hi>bloody ſweat</hi> and <hi>agony</hi> in the <hi>Garden,</hi> by his <hi>tremendious dolors</hi> of Soul and Body on the <hi>Croſs,</hi> prepares a <hi>Cordial,</hi> and perfects it by his <hi>death;</hi> which <hi>prepared Cordial</hi> we by Faith drink up, and from a ſtate of <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>death</hi> revive: he offered himſelf as <hi>good wheat</hi> to be ground by the law and juſtice of God, that thereby he might be <hi>made bread of life</hi> for us by Faith to feed on, that we may live for ever. So that <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s <hi>breaking</hi> and <hi>giving the bread</hi> (in this Sacrament) to his <hi>Church</hi> doth <hi>myſtically declare</hi> that the <hi>ſole intentions</hi> of all his <hi>ſufferings</hi> was for us, and therefore he ſaith, <hi>this is the bread that was broken for you:</hi> and likewiſe <hi>taking and eating</hi> it doth further ſignifie that we do profeſs to believe in him for life, and do rely wholly on him for acceptance with God, and for the ſalvation of our <hi>ſouls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. But why did he add <hi>wine</hi> alſo to this <hi>ſupper,</hi> and commanded us to <hi>drink thereof in remembrance of him?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, this <hi>addition</hi> was for a very good reaſon, for thereby a further <hi>my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of our Salvation</hi> by his <hi>bloody death</hi> is explained.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As firſt, if you conſider that man's <hi>natural life</hi> is not maintained by <hi>eating</hi> only, except he <hi>drink</hi> alſo, for we may dye as well by <hi>thirſt</hi> as by <hi>hunger:</hi> Chriſt therefore by giving us his blood to drink, <hi>which is ſignified by the Cup,</hi> as well as his <hi>body to eat,</hi> doth thereby declare that his <hi>ſuffering of Death for us</hi> is eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry way compleat and ſufficient for the <hi>ſpiritual and eternal life of our ſouls.</hi> So that as he that hath bread and drink, wants nothing for the ſuſtaining his <hi>natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral life,</hi> ſo he that hath by Faith an intereſt in a broken bleeding <hi>Chriſt,</hi> wants nothing to the upholding the Soul in a <hi>ſtate of acceptance</hi> with God, or in a condition of <hi>ſpiritual life,</hi> that is the forerunner and earneſt of a <hi>life of glory.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. But again, if you conſider the <hi>nature of the drink</hi> which he hath appointed, it is <hi>wine</hi> and not <hi>water:</hi> By it may be ſignified thus much; that as there is no ſort of drink ſo grateful to the palate, ſo reviving and ſtrengthning to the ſpirits, ſo that <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> that the Soul is raiſed to by the <hi>Death of Chriſt,</hi> is a life of the greateſt pleaſure and joy that is conceivable; for as no liquor like <hi>Wine</hi> doth chear a ſad <hi>drooping ſpirit,</hi> ſo nothing doth ſo glad and chear the Soul as Faith in a <hi>Crucified Chriſt,</hi> according to that of the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, in whom, though we have not ſeen,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.8.</note> 
               <hi>yet believing, we rejoice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="235" facs="tcp:95740:123"/>
            <p>Thus much for the Duty, <hi>this do.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The end of the Duty, and that is, <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> Here are two things to be inquired into.</p>
            <p n="1">I. What reaſon was there for the inſtituting an Ordinance for his remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance?</p>
            <p n="2">II. Why of all the acts and expreſſions of his love to ſinners above all he would be remembred in his ſufferings for us, which is the ſpecial ſignification of this Supper?</p>
            <p n="1">(1) To the firſt I ſay, you muſt call to mind, that the time of inſtituting this ſupper was the night before that day he died. Now the <hi>conſequent of his Death</hi> was to be this, that he ſhould be taken from Earth to Heaven, there to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonally preſent till the <hi>day of judgment:</hi> Now that his Church on Earth might not forget him in this long abſence, he therefore appointed this ſupper for a frequent quickning them to the remembrance of him till he came again.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) To the other Queſtion I Anſwer: That the reaſons why Jeſus would have this act of his love to be eſpecially remembred above all other, may be theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe his dying for his Church was the greateſt act of love he ever ſhewed his Church. <hi>Greater love</hi> (ſaith Chriſt) <hi>hath no man than this,</hi>
               <note place="margin">John 15.13. 1 John 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>that a man lay down his life for his friends.</hi> Again ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Hereby perceive we the love of God, becauſe he laid down his life for us.</hi> If a man ſhould part with his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, and ſuffer bonds, or lay down his eſtate and become poor, or leave his Country, and become an exile for his friend, theſe were all expreſſions of great love; but none of them are comparable to laying down life and ſhedding ones blood for a friend. This laſt is that wherein Chriſt hath eminently demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his love to his Church, this he glorieth in, and this is that which he would never have his Church forget, but frequently remember in this ſupper.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe that though he gave and ſtill doth give very great teſtimonies of his love to us, as in his Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, Interceſſion, preparing Glory, and laſtly in his coming again to raiſe us, juſtifie us, and to take us to himſelf to behold and enjoy that Glory that he had with the Father before the World was; yet this Ordinance is rather for the remembrance of his bloody Death for us, than for the remembrance of any of the other bleſſings, and why? Becauſe that all theſe other depend on this; Chriſt could never have riſen to our juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, had he not died for the ſatisfaction of the Law and his Fathers Juſtice. Nor would he have been admitted as an Interceſſor, nor have been allowed one manſion in Glory for any of us, nor would his Father have ſuffered him to have returned again to take any one of us to himſelf, if he had not by his death made our peace, opened the new way into the Holy of Holies, and purchaſed a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Reſurrection, and an Aſcenſion to the Heavenly and eternal glory for us: So that ſince all his other acts of love to his Church depend on this of his dying, no wonder if he appointed this Supper for the remembrance of his death ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than any thing elſe he either did or promiſed to do for us.</p>
            <p>The Concluſion is, that ſince that the end of this Ordinance is ſo glorious, and that is the remembrance of the greateſt love that ever God the Father or Son ſhewed to us, it cannot but caſt a Luſtre and Glory upon the duty of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to this Supper, and engage us to a chearful participation thereof.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="236" facs="tcp:95740:124"/>3. The Obligation to this duty: and that is <hi>Chriſt's Command,</hi> this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the <hi>Text</hi> but expreſt in the foregoing verſe: what ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, I have received of the Lord that which alſo I declare unto you.</hi> The Apoſtle doth but <hi>declare,</hi> the <hi>Command</hi> is <hi>Chriſt's,</hi> he is the <hi>Author</hi> of it. It is <hi>Chriſt</hi> not <hi>Paul</hi> that ſaid, <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Commands</hi> are the bonds by which we are tied up to <hi>Obedience,</hi> if we break his bonds we are <hi>tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors.</hi> Remember who they were that <hi>conſpired together</hi> ſaying, <hi>Let us break his bonds aſunder, and caſt away his cords from us;</hi> they were ſuch that <hi>the Lord hath in deriſion,</hi> to whom he will one day <hi>ſpeak in his wrath, and vex them in his ſore diſpleaſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The commands of <hi>ſuperiors</hi> ſet out all duty to <hi>inferiors,</hi> and puniſh for neglect; and the higher or greater the <hi>ſuperior</hi> is, the more authority hath the <hi>command,</hi> and the <hi>greater puniſhment</hi> will be inflicted on the diſobedient. <hi>If diſobedience to the word ſpoken by Angels received a juſt recompence of reward, of how much ſorer puniſhment ſhall they be thought worthy that diſobey the command of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> If a Child's diſobedience deſerves the rod, or a Servants the cudgel, or a Subjects the axe or halter, what doth <hi>diſobedience</hi> to the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> deſerve that is greater than Father, or Maſter, or any earthly Soveraign what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: Take heed then (my brethren) of being found guilty of <hi>neglect</hi> of this <hi>duty</hi> that is bound upon you by the command of ſo <hi>great an authority</hi> as this of the <hi>Lord Jeſus</hi> that hath ſaid, <hi>This do in remembrance of me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In the next place is to be conſidered the <hi>perſons obliged:</hi> and thoſe are the <hi>Church of Chriſt,</hi> ſo far as by <hi>Scriptural Qualifications</hi> they are capacitated to a <hi>participation</hi> thereof, who are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that can <hi>diſcern the Lord's body</hi> in this <hi>ſupper,</hi> the want of this the Apoſtle gives as the reaſon of <hi>unworthy receiving it,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.29. and tells us, <hi>they eat damnation to themſelves.</hi> Now there are two ways wherein the <hi>Lord's body</hi> may be ſaid to be <hi>diſcerned in this ſupper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. When the Underſtanding is ſpiritually enlightned to perceive the true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and ends of this ſupper, and thereby is enabled to ſee a greater difference between this and our ordinary meals; for he that ſhall for want of knowledg therein come to this Table with no better preparations, or to no other intents than when he goes to his own Table, he doth certainly pervert the ends of the inſtitution, and prophanes the Ordinance, and therefore cannot chuſe but incur the great diſpleaſure of God for ſo doing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But there is another way of <hi>diſcerning the Lord</hi>'s <hi>body</hi> in this <hi>ſupper,</hi> and that is by a ſpiritual taſt and reliſh, for the palate hath not a greater ability of diſcerning the different reliſh in the variety of meats man feeds on, than the ſoul of man (that hath its ſpiritual ſenſes exerciſed) hath in taſting the things of God and of judging the different ſweets thereof. This is that ſpiritual facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that Jeſus Chriſt ſpeaks of when he tells <hi>Peter</hi> that he <hi>ſavoured of the things of man,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Math. 16.43:</note> 
               <hi>but not of the things that be of God.</hi> Now this you muſt well obſerve, you that do partake of this Supper, whether you do reliſh the love of the Lord Jeſus in his dying for ſinners and for you in particular: is this great love of Chriſt ſweet to your ſouls, ſweeter than honey or the honey comb? can you admire the heights and depths of this love, and wonder that the Son of God ſhould take a body to be bruiſed, wounded, ſlain for the vileſt of ſinners, among
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:95740:124"/> which you reckon your ſelf as one? do you find this love of his to you draw your hearts to a love of him, and a delight in him, and a readineſs to part with all for him? this is indeed to <hi>diſcern the Lord's body</hi> in this <hi>ſupper:</hi> and by this you are enabled to ſee a <hi>vaſt difference</hi> betwixt this <hi>ſupper</hi> and all the <hi>feaſts of fat things</hi> that ever you were at in all your lives. If it be ſo with you, then are you qualified for this <hi>ſupper,</hi> and are by <hi>Chriſt's command</hi> obliged to partake thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that have fellowſhip <hi>with God in Chriſt,</hi> they are thoſe Chriſt hath obliged by his command to partake of this ſupper.</p>
            <p>This is another qualification the Apoſtle gives us in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.18, 20, 21. where diſcourſing of the <hi>nature of Divine</hi> and likewiſe of <hi>Diabolical ſacrifices,</hi> &amp; of the reaſon of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>Peoples</hi> eating ſome part thereof, he alſo ſhews the reaſon of our <hi>partaking of the Lord's Table,</hi> which (though it is not properly a ſacrifice that is there offered, yet it) holds ſome reſemblance unto the <hi>ſacrifices of the Law</hi> and to the Peoples eating thereof, inaſmuch as it is a Commemoration of that <hi>one ſacrifice</hi> Chriſt offered up to the Father for our ſins, of the benefits of which <hi>one ſacrifice,</hi> thoſe that <hi>communicate</hi> at the <hi>Lord's Table</hi> do as <hi>effectually partake,</hi> as if Chriſt was offered up as often as you there do eat and drink.</p>
            <p>Now ſaith the Apoſtle of the <hi>Legal ſacrifices, v.</hi> 18. <hi>they which eat thereof are partakers of the Altar;</hi> that is, are partakers of the bleſſings of that God to whom that altar is erected, and to whom thoſe <hi>ſacrifices</hi> are offered. And not only ſo, but there is yet a further meaning, which is, that thoſe that eat of the Altar do thereby declare that they take the God of that Altar to be their God, from whom they expect all that good they are capable of in this life, and that which is to come, and likewiſe they thereby declare that him, and him only will they <hi>wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and ſerve.</hi> Now this engagement of themſelves to God ſignified by <hi>eating</hi> of the <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> is that <hi>fellowſhip</hi> ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 20. where the Apoſtle further tells you that there is the very ſame <hi>intendment</hi> in thoſe <hi>ſacrifices</hi> that are offered to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> and the peoples eating of thoſe <hi>feaſts</hi> that attended thoſe <hi>ſacrifices;</hi> they thereby did ſignifie that they took thoſe <hi>Devils</hi> to be their <hi>Gods,</hi> and reſolved for the future to <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> them as Gods, which is the proper meaning of that 20 <hi>v. But I ſay, that the things which the Gentiles ſacrifice, they ſacrifice to devils and not to God, and I would not that ye ſhould have fellowſhip with devils, i.e.</hi> I would that you would not <hi>aſſociate</hi> with devils, or enter into a <hi>confederacy</hi> with them to <hi>ſerve</hi> and <hi>worſhip</hi> them, as the <hi>Idol-feaſts</hi> do ſignifie. Now if the <hi>Idol-feaſts</hi> ſignified the confederacy betwixt the <hi>Devils</hi> and their <hi>worſhippers,</hi> ſo alſo did the feaſt that attended the <hi>Jewiſh ſacrifice</hi> ſignifie a <hi>fellowſhip</hi> betwixt the <hi>true God</hi> and his <hi>worſhippers,</hi> whereby the true God was <hi>acknowledged</hi> as their God, and that they would <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> him only. Thus the Apoſtle having illuſtrated the meaning of eating of the Jewiſh and alſo of the Gentile ſacrifice, he proceeds to accommodate thoſe notions to that of the Lord's Table, <hi>v.</hi> 21. <hi>Ye cannot drink the cup of the Lord, and the cup of Devils: ye cannot be partakes of the Lord's Table, and of the table of devils.</hi> The meaning is this; you cannot ſerve two ſuch contrary Maſters as the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus, and devils alſo: for if you eat of Idols feaſts, you thereby declare you own devils as Gods, and then coming to the Lord's Table, you thereby declare you only acknowledg the true God to be your God in and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:95740:125"/> through Jeſus Chriſt your <hi>Sacrifice and Mediator,</hi> which practices are very abſurd and contradictory. The Concluſion is this, that thoſe that partake of the <hi>Lord's Table,</hi> are ſuch that from the heart do take the God of that Chriſt whoſe death is remembred in that Supper, to be their God, and that do believe that God is <hi>really reconciled</hi> to them by <hi>that ſacrifice,</hi> and they declare likewiſe hereby they will <hi>worſhip</hi> and <hi>ſerve</hi> this God in this Chriſt, and him only: now if any of you are thus engaged to God in Spirit, you have <hi>fellowſhip with him,</hi> and you are thoſe that have <hi>right to partake of this Supper.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having thus opened the words of the Text, I ſhall now give you that chief point I would have you obſerve, which is this.</p>
            <p>Doct. <hi>That it is the indiſpenſable duty of all ſuch members of Jeſus Chriſt (that can diſcern the Lord's body in this Lord's Supper, and have fellowſhip with the Father by this crucified Jeſus) to come to this Supper, and to partake there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is not any thing in the <hi>Doctrine</hi> I ſhall inſiſt on, except this one, which is to prove it is your <hi>duty to partake of it,</hi> and that it is therefore <hi>indiſpenſable,</hi> becauſe the neglect of it is a <hi>very great ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which I prove by this one argument: Jeſus Chriſt who inſtituted it, he hath commanded you to <hi>remember him in it;</hi> and therefore if you do it not, you <hi>break his command,</hi> and what is that but to <hi>ſin againſt him?</hi> for what elſe is ſin, but either to do what your God and Saviour forbids, or not to do what he commands? this is ſo plain that it were but to waſte time to uſe more words for the clearing thereof. What I have therefore more to ſay is to ſhew you thoſe many things that <hi>accompany this ſin,</hi> that tend to aggravate it, that, when you underſtand not only that the neglect of this duty is a ſin, but a very great one, you may be deterred from <hi>continuing any longer in it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. I beſeech you conſider whoſe <hi>command</hi> it is you break: it is the <hi>command of the Lord Jeſus;</hi> to remember him in this Supper is a debt you ow to him your Saviour, Lord, and head; it is a command that bears the <hi>ſuperſcription</hi> of the moſt <hi>ſupreme Authority in Heaven or Earth,</hi> and if by the ſentence of Chriſt it was but juſt to pay the <hi>tribute-money</hi> to <hi>Caeſar,</hi> becauſe it bore his <hi>ſuperſcription,</hi> it is much more juſt for you to pay the <hi>tribute of obedience to this command,</hi> that bears the <hi>ſuperſcription</hi> of an Authority greater than all the <hi>Caeſars</hi> that ever were. What's the name of <hi>Caeſar</hi> in compare to the name and title of the <hi>Son of God?</hi> which is a title that ſpeaks him greater than all Angels or Arch-Angels in Heaven; <hi>for to which of his Angels ſaid he at any time, thou art my Son,</hi>

<pb n="239" facs="tcp:95740:125"/> ſick and others dead for <hi>profaning this Supper,</hi> he can do as much to you for not <hi>obſerving it;</hi> and that he doth not, is not becauſe he wants power, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is gracious, long ſuffering, not willing you ſhould periſh for your <hi>neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect,</hi> but that you may be drawn to <hi>repentance,</hi> and ſo to <hi>obedience;</hi> but if you be obſtinate after you are told throughly of your fault, take heed, it will be a horrible thing for you to fall into the hands of <hi>conſuming fire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider your neglect of this <hi>Ordinance</hi> is a ſin againſt the <hi>command,</hi> not only of the greateſt, but of the beſt <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> he is not only <hi>Maximus</hi> but <hi>Optimus</hi> alſo, this is a further aggravation of your ſin. Who ever thought but that <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s taking up arms againſt <hi>David</hi> was treaſon? but he that ſhall conſider that the <hi>rebellion</hi> was againſt <hi>David</hi> the <hi>man after God's own heart:</hi> againſt <hi>David</hi> the holieſt of men, and the juſteſt of Princes, and beſides all this, againſt <hi>David</hi> his Father: cannot but judge it an act of the <hi>higheſt treaſon</hi> imaginable. My brethren, in your diſobeying this command, you ſin againſt <hi>Jeſus the juſt,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus the gracious,</hi> againſt him that is by place your head; in love your Father; in openneſs of heart your Friend; againſt him that emptied himſelf that he might fill you, that became poor that he might enrich you, that became an exile from his Throne and Father's Kingdom, that he might bring you home to your Father's houſe, that became a curſe that you might be bleſſed, that hung on a tree for you, that you might ſit on <hi>Thrones</hi> with him, who called you and waſhed you from your ſins in his blood; and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all this, when he ſhall leave ſuch a command as this, <hi>to remember him in this Supper,</hi> for all this his love: how <hi>inexcuſable</hi> muſt your neglect be? let your Conſcience be judge, with whom I leave it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you conſider what <hi>relation</hi> you that are believers ſtand in to this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus that left this command with you; ye are the <hi>Elect of the Father</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted you to his <hi>Son to Redeem,</hi> and <hi>effectually call you,</hi> that he might ſave you from ſin, wrath, the grave, Hell, and to bring you to <hi>everlaſting glory.</hi> Why are you called <hi>believers</hi> but from that faith whereby you acknowledg this Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus as your Lord and your God, whereby you truſt in him, and in what he hath done and ſuffered for you, for the making your peace, procuring your pardon, and opening a <hi>new and living way</hi> into your <hi>Father's Kingdom</hi> and <hi>glory:</hi> it is by this faith that you love him, cleave to him, and are therefore called his <hi>friends,</hi> his <hi>children,</hi> his <hi>brethren,</hi> his <hi>ſubjects, ſervants, followers, witneſſes;</hi> and ſhall ſuch as you be found <hi>diſobedient</hi> to him? ſhall you care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſly forget to remember him in a ſupper appointed by himſelf for the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the greateſt act of his love, that is, his dying for you? I tell you Chriſt will take it worſe of you than of any others: how hainouſly did <hi>David</hi> take a contempt from his friend, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.9. <hi>Yea mine own familiar friend, in whom I truſted, which did eat of my bread, hath lift up his heel againſt me,</hi> ye are thoſe that he hath choſen out of the world, brought into his Father's fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and for you to turn the heel upon him and refuſe to eat at his <hi>Table,</hi> this is a contempt that cannot but grieve and anger him: when Chriſt had been teaching that they who did not <hi>eat his fleſh</hi> and <hi>drink his blood,</hi> had no life in them, at this multitudes were offended and forſook him, but (ſaith he) to his Diſciples, <hi>will ye go alſo,</hi> implying, that if they ſhould forſake him, it would be matter of greater trouble than that of the multitudes leaving him.<note place="margin">John 6.53.67.</note>
               <pb n="240" facs="tcp:95740:126"/> That the profane world comes not nigh his Table; that comes not ſo nigh his heart, but that ye believers ſhould withdraw, this is that which he muſt needs take ill from you. Oh do not as you tender the good pleaſure of your Lord, do not grieve him by <hi>abſenting</hi> your ſelves from his table.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If you conſider the command it ſelf as it is eaſie, pleaſant, honourable, your neglect muſt needs receive <hi>further aggravation.</hi> What is more eaſie than to eat and drink, or more pleaſant than to come to a feaſt, or more honourable than to feaſt with the King of Kings. Chriſt puts you not upon the painful duty of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſing your fleſh, nor on the troubleſom duty of waſhing your ſelves every time you touch a dead carcaſe, or what is ceremonially unclean, nor on the coſtly duties of ſacrificing your Lambs, Goats or Oxen; nor on the coſtly and toilſom duties of travelling ſcores of miles every year to feaſt before the Lord at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> to which the Church of the Jews were bound; he hath eaſed you of all theſe burdens, and made your task far eaſier, inſtead of all theſe he hath inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted but two duties like them, the one of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> the trouble of which you are to undergo but once in all your lives, and the other of this Supper, which you may have without travelling far for, and which coſts you next to nothing.</p>
            <p>But further, it is a duty not leſs pleaſant than eaſie, what is more pleaſant than a feaſt? and this of all feaſts is the ſweeteſt, if the periſhing Manna in the wilderneſs were ſo delicious as that the taſt of it was like wafers made with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney,<note place="margin">Exod. 16.31.</note> how much more delicious muſt this celeſtial <hi>Manna,</hi> this bread of <hi>eternal life</hi> be which is ſpread before you in this Supper? it is a feaſt of love, of the love of the Father and of the Son; there is a voice in every morſel of bread you there eat, and in every draught of wine you there drink, ſaying, <hi>behold O ſinners how you are beloved of the Father and Son; had not the Father loved you he would never have parted with his Son, and if the Son had not loved you, he would never have parted with his life for you. Oh therefore come ye to this Supper, come eat and drink ye beloved of the Lord, and remembes his love more than wine; let all the redeemed of the Lord come hither and praiſe him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is it a duty leſs honourable than pleaſant: it is a pleaſant thing to feaſt, but it is honorable to feaſt with a King, moſt honorable with the King of Kings and Lord of the whole earth. How did <hi>Haman</hi> glory that he was invited to the banquet with the King? he reckoned not of it as his task but his priviledg, not as his work but his reward. And ſhall a feaſt with an earthly mortal King be more valued than a feaſt with the heavenly and immortal God? this Supper is the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> it is the great God hath made the proviſion, and it is his eternal Son that hath made the invitation. Oh take heed of excuſes, for though you make them, God will not take them; make therefore your ſelves ready, put on your wedding-garments and come away; let not a Table ſo well furniſhed want its gueſts, leaſt Chriſt loſe the honour and you the comfort of the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment. But if you will ſtill draw back, know this, that you do not only ſin, but that your ſin is great becauſe againſt a command that is ſo eaſie, ſweet, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable as I have ſhewn you this is.</p>
            <p n="5">5. There is one circumſtance more in the command which ſhould quicken you to the <hi>obſervance,</hi> and that is the <hi>time</hi> when this <hi>command</hi> was given. It was the very night in which he was <hi>betrayed,</hi> the very laſt night he lived on the <hi>earth,</hi> the night before that day in which he <hi>offered up himſelf a ſacrifice</hi> to <hi>juſtice</hi> for
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:95740:126"/> us. Then it was he ſaid <hi>do this in remembrance of me.</hi> As if he had ſaid, my friends, I am now to leave you and to be taken out of your <hi>ſight,</hi> but oh! let me not be out of your <hi>mind,</hi> to morrow you ſhall ſee how I love you, when you ſee me <hi>ſcorned of men, deſerted of God, praying, groaning, bleeding, dying</hi> for you, oh let not that love of mine be <hi>forgotten:</hi> and leaſt it ſhould, I therefore <hi>inſtitute</hi> this <hi>ſupper,</hi> charging you with my <hi>whole Church</hi> till I come again, that ſo often as they eat this <hi>bread</hi> and drink this <hi>cup</hi> they <hi>remember</hi> me. This is the charge of our <hi>dying Lord,</hi> and ſurely if we have any love for him we ſhould not dare but obſerve it. When <hi>Jacob</hi> was dying, he gave in charge as ſome of his <hi>laſt words,</hi> that <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſhould <hi>forgive the unkindneſs of his brethren;</hi> and when he was dead, the brethren thought it a good <hi>argument</hi> to move <hi>Joſeph</hi> to take pitty on them: they there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſent <hi>meſſengers</hi> to <hi>Joſeph,</hi> ſaying, <hi>thy Father did command before he died,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen 50.16, 17, 18.</note> 
               <hi>ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forgive I pray thee, the treſpaſs of thy brethren:</hi> this argument broke <hi>Joſephs</hi> heart, it is ſaid <hi>he wept when they ſpake unto him, and ſaid fear not:</hi> oh how did the words of his <hi>dying Father</hi> move and melt him! methinks I hear him ſay, was this the deſire of my dying Father? I cannot then but yield; would my Father have me forgive? I freely do it. Now (my brethren) why ſhould you not do as much for your <hi>dying Jeſus,</hi> as <hi>Joſeph</hi> for his <hi>dying Jacob?</hi> was <hi>Jacob</hi> his <hi>Father? Jeſus</hi> is our <hi>Saviour;</hi> did <hi>Jacob</hi> love <hi>Joſeph?</hi> but he did not dye for him as Jeſus did for us; and ſhall we find a heart to deny our Lord in his <hi>dying requeſt,</hi> when <hi>Joſeph</hi> could not find one to deny his Father? oh then as <hi>Joſeph</hi> forgave, ſo let us. <hi>This do in remembrance of him,</hi> which will be an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of that great love and honour we do keep for his <hi>memory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. In the next place, I deſire you would think of the contempt you throw upon this <hi>Ordinance</hi> by your <hi>neglect.</hi> What is it but that you have ſlight thoughts of the Authority of the Inſtitutor, and very mean thoughts of the inſtitution it ſelf? and is not this to proclaim to the world that there is (in your judgment) a command of the <hi>Lord Chriſt,</hi> and a duty in the Chriſtian Religion that is fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous and childiſh, not worth the obſervance? believe it, the World will judg of it by your <hi>practice</hi> and not by your <hi>profeſſion.</hi> The <hi>Rechabites</hi> would drink no wine becauſe <hi>Jonadab</hi> the ſon of <hi>Rechab</hi> did forbid them; nor will the <hi>Turks</hi> drink wine becauſe that Impoſtor <hi>Mahomet</hi> forbad them; thus the one honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red their <hi>Father,</hi> and the other their <hi>falſe Prophet:</hi> and will you that are <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians</hi> let theſe men riſe up in judgment againſt you? ſhall error be more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valent with them, than truth with you? and will you let the <hi>Turks</hi> outdo you, in honouring a falſe prophet more than you do the true? is <hi>Mahomet</hi> dearer and his inſtitutions more ſacred to his followers, then <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution are to you? <hi>Chriſt</hi> bids you drink of this cup in remembrance of him and you will not, but <hi>Mahomet</hi> forbids them wine and they obey him: judg you now who gives the greateſt honor, they to <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or you to <hi>Chriſt?</hi> methinks you ſhould bluſh to think of it: Oh Chriſtians for ſhame amend, and give no more occaſion to Chriſt's Miniſters to reprove you for ſo groſs a ſin.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I have not yet done. Think once more with what hypocriſie this neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect is accompanied.

            <p n="8">8. Conſider again, how ſcandalous you are in this <hi>neglect.</hi> There are not a few about this <hi>Kingdom,</hi> that are <hi>Antient Chriſtians,</hi> that have a long time had the reputation of <hi>wiſdom, ſobriety,</hi> and <hi>godlineſs</hi> in their lives, that yet are noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly guilty in this matter.

            <p n="9">9. Once again let me intreat you to lay to heart, how unworthily hereby you caſt <hi>contempt</hi> upon the practice of the Churches of Chriſt in all Ages paſt. Tell me if you can, what Church of Chriſtians for 1600 years but have made conſcience of this duty. In <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time, by what we can gather from his writings, it ſeems the Church alwaies cloſed their ſolemn publick meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with this ſupper. And <hi>Auſtin</hi> tells us, there were Chriſtians in his days that were for taking it every day of the week; and though he himſelf thought ſuch daily participation thereof was not needful, yet he perſwaded to partake thereof every Lord's day. <hi>Quotidie (inquit) Euchariſtiae commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nionem
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:95740:127"/> percipere nec laudo nec vitupero; omnibus tamen Dominicis diebus commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicandum ſuadeo.</hi> Now though Chriſt hath not expreſly tied us to ſuch a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, yet he hath intimated to us, he would have himſelf remembred herein very often, when he ſaith, <hi>ſo often as you eat this bread:</hi> But for you to live in a perpetual neglect, is very far from taking it often. It was a ſaying of Aſaph,<note place="margin">Pſal. 73.15.</note> 
               <hi>If I ſpeak thus, I ſhould offend againſt the generation of thy children.</hi> Oh that you would conſider that ſo long as you continue this neglect, you offend againſt the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God in <hi>many generations,</hi> even from the time of the <hi>inſtitution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. Laſtly, do but think how unmerciful you are to your own ſouls in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them this <hi>Ordinance.</hi> What do you but with-hold their proper and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary food from them? you call upon them to exerciſe their graces, and you find them faint and languid; you then complain of them, Oh what a dead and liſtleſs heart have I to God and duty? Alas man! it is thy own fault, thou like an <hi>Aegyptian</hi> taskmaſter calleſt for the tale of brick and denieſt ſtraw, thou calleſt to thy ſoul to do her work, and wilt not give her the bread to refreſh her which her Saviour hath allowed. Bring thy ſoul to this Supper, feed her, ſatisfie her with a crucified Jeſus that is there preſented, and then tell me whether her Faith will not ſtrengthen, her love increaſe, her joys and conſolations multiply. Ask your brethren what taſts and reliſhes, what ſweet refreſhments they have received from the Lord in this <hi>Ordinance?</hi> they will cry unto you, Oh come taſt and ſee how gracious God is to us at this Feaſt. It was a ſaying of <hi>Bernard, Cum defecerit virtus mea non conturbor, non diffido, Scio quid faciam, Calicem ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutarem accipiam,</hi> that is, when my ſtrength faileth me, I am not troubled, I do not deſpond, I know a remedy, I will go to the Table of the Lord, there I will drink and recover my decayed ſtrength: and I dare ſay, that good man expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced no more but what ten thouſands of the Lord's people do frequently experience. Where would you have Chriſt give you his loves, but in his garden of ſpices, in his wine cellar, where his banner over you is love? Here it is he broaches his ſide and lets out his heart blood to you, which is more ſweet to a believing ſinner than the moſt delicious banquet to the moſt hungry appetite; and if it proves not ſo to all that come, it is becauſe of their own indiſpoſitions, and not becauſe of any deficiency in the Ordinance it ſelf. And now I had done, were it not that I underſtand there are ſome Objections to be removed, which I ſhall propoſe and anſwer, and then leave you to the bleſſing of the Lord for to give you a full ſatisfaction in the whole matter.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> True, it is a Ceremony, but it is ſuch an one that beareth the ſtamp of the Authority of the Lord Jeſus; if he appoints it, will you ſlight it, and ſay it is but a Ceremony? But again, if it be a Ceremony it is the moſt glorious one that ever was appointed, in as much as it is deſigned to ſet forth the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of the world as it was compleated and perfected by the death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. Yet again, it is but a Ceremony, but you are greatly miſtaken if you think that therefore there is no danger to neglect it: what was the tree of knowledg of good and evil but a Ceremony? yet for diſobedience in eating thereof do you not know and feel what wrath it hath brought
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:95740:128"/> on the whole race of mankind? and tell me, was <hi>Circumciſion</hi> any more than a <hi>Ceremony?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Exod. 24.25.</note> yet it had almoſt coſt <hi>Moſes</hi> his life for neglecting to <hi>circumciſe</hi> his ſon for the <hi>Angel</hi> ſtood ready with his ſword to ſlay him, if he had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it by his <hi>obedience.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>Object.</hi> But I remember a crucified Saviour in the Word read and preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I ſee him there lifted up and dying for me, and I (bleſs God) to my great comfort. How needleſs a thing then is it to remember him in this ſupper ſo?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Vain man would be vviſer than Chriſt, who is the <hi>Wiſdom of his Father. Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath thought fit not only to <hi>command</hi> that himſelf ſhould be <hi>Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to his Church, but alſo <hi>remembred</hi> in this <hi>ſupper.</hi> But thou doſt ſay, <hi>(oh pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption!)</hi> that the firſt vvas ſufficient, the latter is needleſs and impertinent. Wilt thou undertake to give counſel to the <hi>Son of God,</hi> or adviſe him in the affairs of his <hi>Kingdom?</hi> ſhall the Holy Ghoſt ſay, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.5. <hi>He was faithful in his houſe as a Son,</hi> and wilt thou argue him of weakneſs in his Adminiſtrations; <hi>Job</hi> 40.2. <hi>He that reproveth the Son of God, let him anſwer it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But why ſhouldeſt thou ſay this Supper is needleſs becauſe Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred in the Word? may not truth in ſome caſes be more effectually conveyed to the ſoul by the eye than ear? do you not find your ſelves more moved to See the execution of a man, to See one hanged or beheaded, than barely to hear the ſtory of it? <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> in this <hi>Ordinance</hi> is as it were cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified before your eyes, in a manner more affecting than when you only hear of his <hi>crucifixion</hi> by the Word. But further, this <hi>Supper</hi> hath further ends than the <hi>Word preached,</hi> for <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Covenant of Grace</hi> founded in his blood, is preached to the intent that you may Believe, and enter into this <hi>Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God;</hi> but the Supper is inſtituted as an <hi>outward ſign</hi> to Ratifie this <hi>Covenant</hi> betwixt God and you, after it hath been once entred into by Faith, you do not think it enough in <hi>marriage</hi> to take one another's word, but you compleat it by a ſolemn <hi>vow</hi> in the preſence of <hi>witneſſes.</hi> I tell you <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath not thought it enough to take your <hi>word,</hi> but he will have it confirmed ſolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:95740:128"/> by this <hi>Ordinance,</hi> and this he will have often repeated, for he knows us too well as to our proneneſs to backſliding, which by this <hi>ſupper</hi> he would prevent.</p>
            <p>But yet further, who is it dare preſume to give <hi>Chriſt</hi> his meaſures, how, and where, and by what means he ſhould manifeſt himſelf and his love to his belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers? what if he hath reſerved ſome <hi>peculiar degrees</hi> of light and ſtrength and comfort to convey to his people by this <hi>Supper,</hi> that he thinks not fit ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily to do by his Word? and if it be ſo,<note place="margin">Luke 24.</note> who ſhall ſay to him why doſt thou thus? I remember what is recorded of the two Diſciples travelling to <hi>Emaus,</hi> by their diſcourſe it appeared that they doubted <hi>whether Jeſus was the Chriſt,</hi> Chriſt meeting with them and perceiving that their Faith ſtaggered, took this method, firſt he endeavoured to ſettle them in their Faith, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had been <hi>crucified</hi> and <hi>buried,</hi> that yet he was the true Chriſt, which he did by <hi>expounding Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> from whence he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that it was neceſſary that <hi>Chriſt muſt ſuffer;</hi> and this vvas vvith <hi>good effect</hi> upon their hearts, for they ſaid, <hi>did not our hearts burn within us when we heard him?</hi> but yet he reſerved a fuller manifeſtation of himſelf to them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till he came to break bread with them at their houſe; then it is ſaid, <hi>their eyes were opened and they knew that it was he.</hi> I do not ſay that breaking of bread in that place was the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> in the ſenſe I ſpeak of it; but it will ſerve me ſo far as to illuſtrate what I intend, which is this: <hi>That it may be the pleaſure of Chriſt to intail peculiar manifeſtations of himſelf to his people upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ordinances;</hi> he will beget faith by the <hi>preaching of the word,</hi> and ſet your hearts in a flame of love to him from vvhat you hear there, and yet may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the confirmation of your faith and eſtabliſhment of your love to him, to be wrought by this of the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> which is that which many of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have experienced. And therefore it cannot be ſaid to be in vain to have Chriſt preſented to you in the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> as well as in the <hi>Lord's word preached;</hi> and this I conceive abundantly enough to ſilence this objection.</p>
            <p n="4">4th <hi>Objection.</hi> But I am not prepared <hi>worthily to receive,</hi> and therefore I dare not come to this Table, leaſt I <hi>eat and drink damnation to my ſelf.</hi>

This <hi>Supper</hi> hath been explained, why haſt thou not underſtood it? if thou hadſt but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of thy ſins, and believed in the Lord Jeſus, and underſtood the meaning of this Supper, thou hadſt been prepared for a worthy receiving of it: but if it be not thus with thee it is thy own fault, get thee therefore into thy cloſet, humble thy ſelf mightily before the Lord for this long abuſe of the means of grace; and pray him to give thee that repentance, faith and knowledg that may make thee worthy: and be aſſured that God is merciful,<note place="margin">Jam. 1.

               <hi>and giveth liberally to thoſe that ask, and upbraideth no man: ask and you ſhall have, ſeek and you ſhall find.</hi> But if you will not be at this pains, thy unworthineſs is voluntary, and thy complaint of unfitneſs is meer hypocriſie: and then remember the many woes denounced againſt Hypocrites.</p>
            <p>Yet there may be ſome children of God that are prepared, but yet dare not come, becauſe they do not underſtand that they are prepared.</p>

            <p>To theſe I ſay, if through <hi>ignorance</hi> of your own ſtate you be kept off, why do you not come to ſuch <hi>Miniſters</hi> that you judg <hi>faithful</hi> to help you? you will carry your <hi>evidences</hi> to men <hi>skilful in the Law</hi> to judg of your title to an <hi>earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inheritance;</hi> and if your body be under ſome <hi>diſtemper,</hi> you will ask your <hi>Phyſician</hi> what he thinks of you; and why will you not then go to ſome able <hi>Miniſter,</hi> and ask his <hi>judgment</hi> of you, and deſire his <hi>directions?</hi> I dare ſay this courſe would ſet many a <hi>weak Chriſtian</hi> at <hi>liberty</hi> from his <hi>doubts</hi> and <hi>perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,</hi> which have and may ſo intangle him, that as he yet hath not ſeen his right to his <hi>priviledges,</hi> ſo he may go on in this darkneſs (for ought I know) to his death. Be therefore perſwaded to take advice.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Concluſion</hi> is this, I would that all of you whoſe conſciences bear you witneſs that you are the <hi>Lord's people,</hi> and that you have given your ſelves up to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> would take up a <hi>reſolution</hi> to be <hi>obedient</hi> to the <hi>Lord</hi> in coming to this <hi>Supper</hi> as he hath <hi>commanded;</hi> and as you have heard this morning, take heed of ſinning againſt <hi>light,</hi> with your eyes wide open upon it; ſins of <hi>ignorance</hi> God may wink at, but when you ſin <hi>preſumptuouſly,</hi> though it be againſt the leaſt <hi>command,</hi> and perſevere in it, I queſtion whether it be conſiſtent with <hi>ſalvation;</hi> but if it be, doubtleſs it will be a Salvation through the fire.

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Hoſe words are an anſwer to a queſtion, or rather a reply to an objection made by the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt concerning Faſting, <hi>v.</hi> 18. <hi>And the Diſciples of</hi> John <hi>and the Phariſees uſed to faſt, and they come and ſay unto him, why do the Diſciples of</hi> John <hi>and the Phariſees faſt, but thy Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples faſt not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt</hi> returns his anſwer by a fit parable (as that was his uſual way of teaching) <hi>v.</hi> 19. <hi>Can the Children of the Bride-chamber faſt while the Bridegroom is with them? as long as they have the Bridegroom with them they cannot faſt.</hi> And ſo the duty was not now in ſeaſon. We have the ſame ſtory recorded by two other <hi>Evangeliſts, Math.</hi> 9. <hi>Luke</hi> 5. only with this difference. In <hi>Matthew</hi> we read it was only <hi>the Diſciples of John</hi> that made the objection, but in <hi>Mark</hi> and <hi>Luke</hi> is added <hi>the Diſciples of John and the Phariſees.</hi> Again, <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark</hi> mention only <hi>faſting, Luke</hi> addeth <hi>why do the Diſciples of John faſt often and make prayers:</hi> he means it of the <hi>prayers</hi> uſed by them upon their <hi>faſt days Luke</hi> alſo addeth <hi>but eat and drink:</hi> here was the objection.</p>
            <p>Wherein we ſhall firſt conſider the <hi>occaſion</hi> of it, and then the <hi>perſons</hi> that made it, and then the reply that <hi>Chriſt</hi> maketh to it, which will bring me to the Text.</p>
            <p>The occaſion of it was</p>
            <p>Firſt, That which is mentioned by all theſe <hi>Evangeliſts, Chriſt</hi>'s entring the houſe of <hi>Levi</hi> the <hi>Publican,</hi> vvho had made him a great feaſt, and there was a great company of <hi>Publicans</hi> and others preſent, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> ſat down and did eat and drink vvith them. Now this was one ground of the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, That <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Diſciples</hi> did not uſe that auſterity and abſtinence in meat and drinks as they ought, but did too much indulge their ſenſual appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite, as elſewhere he was accuſed as a <hi>wine-bibber</hi> and <hi>gluttonous, Math.</hi> 11.19. eſpecially ſeeing he did eat and drink with <hi>Publicans and ſinners.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, The <hi>Diſciples</hi> of <hi>John</hi> and the <hi>Phariſees</hi> uſed ſeveral faſts beſides the <hi>Annual faſt</hi> enjoined by the <hi>Law</hi> upon the ſeventh month and the tenth day of the month for the whole congregation of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> As we read of their
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:95740:130"/> often faſting, <hi>Math.</hi> 9.14. <hi>Luke</hi> 5.33. And the <hi>Phariſee</hi> mentioned <hi>Luke</hi> 18.12. pleads, <hi>I faſt twice in the week,</hi> and <hi>Chemnitius</hi> in his <hi>Harmony</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures they did ſtill obſerve the faſts of the fourth moneth, and fifth month, ſeventh and tenth moneth that the Jews obſerved in the 70 years captivity mentioned <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.19. As alſo that which was obſerved by <hi>Eſther</hi> and her Maidens, <hi>Mordecai,</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Shuſhan,</hi> before <hi>her going into the King, to ſpeak for the lives of her people, Eſther</hi> 4.16. to preſerve the ſolemn re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the calamities of thoſe times, he thinks they kept ſtill thoſe faſts; but beſides, they obſerved many Faſts deviſed and appointed by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which may be reckoned among the <hi>Traditions</hi> of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon their Diſciples. Now <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Diſciples not faſting as they faſted, was another ground of the objection, as is expreſly mentioned by the <hi>Evangeliſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Next we may conſider the perſons that make the objection, whereby we may ſee yet further ground of it. It was the Diſciples of the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>John.</hi> Theſe <hi>Phariſees</hi> were the chief Ring-leaders upon all occaſions in any op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition againſt Chriſt; one while they object againſt him and his Diſciples for not obſerving the <hi>Sabbath.</hi> Another while for not <hi>waſhing</hi> before they did eat, and ſometimes for his too much familiarity with <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. And here for <hi>not faſting.</hi> And now they ingaged the Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> with them that they might make their objection and oppoſition the more plauſible, for <hi>John</hi> was in great <hi>reputation with the people.</hi> Wherein <hi>John's Diſciples</hi> were juſtly to be blamed for joining with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in an oppoſition to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who were his inveterate adverſaries. But <hi>John</hi> their Maſter being now in Priſon, they were the more eaſily drawn in with them, for had he been with them he would not have ſuffered ſuch a thing: (his great errand and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs being to raiſe up the reputation of <hi>Chriſt</hi> among the people, to remove prejudices againſt him, to prepare the way for him, and to turn the hearts of the people to him.) A pregnant inſtance whereof we have <hi>John</hi> 3.26, 27, 28. where <hi>John's Diſciples</hi> came with a ſtory to their Maſter, <hi>Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond</hi> Jordan, <hi>to whom thou beareſt witneſs, behold the ſame baptizeth, and all come to him,</hi> but <hi>John</hi> anſwered, <hi>A man can receive no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, except it be given from above, ye your ſelves bear me witneſs that I ſaid I was not the Chriſt, but that I am ſent before him. He that hath the bride is the Bridegroom,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>he muſt increaſe, but I muſt decreaſe; John</hi> would not ſuffer any envy or prejudice to remain in the hearts of his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> upon his account, but ſeeks to check it preſently. But he being now not preſent with them, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> more eaſily ingaged them in this oppoſition and objection againſt <hi>Chriſt</hi> about Faſting, to join with them therein. And the zeal that <hi>John's Diſciples</hi> had for the reputation of their Maſter might ſomewhat incline them alſo to it; for they ſaw the people following <hi>Chriſt:</hi> which they thought might be ſome eclipſe to it, and conſequently to their own, as they were his <hi>Diſciples.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And beſides they knowing the auſterity and abſtinence that was practis'd by <hi>John, (his meat being locuſts and wild honey,</hi> ſuch food as he found in the
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:95740:130"/> wilderneſs) they might be more eaſily offended at that greater liberty that was taken by Chriſt and his Diſciples about eating and drinking.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially at this time when their Maſter was in Priſon, they thought faſting might be more ſeaſonable than going to a feaſt, as Chriſt and his Diſciples did at the houſe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> obſerves upon the place.</p>
            <p>Next we have Chriſt's reply to the Objection, and he preſents it in a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as I ſaid; the <hi>parable</hi> of a <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> who at his wedding hath his Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Bridemaids attending him in the wedding chamber, who according to the <hi>Hebrew Dialect</hi> are here called the <hi>Children of the Bride-chamber.</hi> And is it then a proper ſeaſon for their faſting, while they are in the <hi>wedding-chamber,</hi> and the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> with them.</p>
            <p>Wherein Chriſt doth repreſent himſelf as a <hi>Bridegroom,</hi> and his Diſciples as the <hi>Children of the Bride-chamber.</hi> And he doth now repreſent himſelf thus, the rather to put theſe Diſciples of <hi>John</hi> in remembrance of their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſpeech when he call'd <hi>Chriſt the Bridegroom.</hi> As we read <hi>John</hi> 3.29. <hi>He that hath the Bride is the Bridegroom.</hi> And ſhould then his Diſciples faſt and mourn while Chriſt the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was with them? And their Maſter <hi>John</hi> he profeſt that he was the friend of this Bridegroom, and rejoyced great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to hear his voice, <hi>John</hi> 3.29. And therefore why ſhould they be offended at his Diſciples that they did not faſt and mourn, when their Maſter <hi>John</hi> rejoiced, and had his joy fulfill'd in hearing his voice; as we read <hi>John</hi> 3.29.</p>
            <p>And herein Chriſt doth intimate to them, that if they were indeed his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, and the children of the <hi>Bride-chamber,</hi> they would not faſt neither; for the children of the <hi>Bride-chamber</hi> cannot faſt while the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> is with them.</p>
            <p>But he adds; <hi>The days will come</hi> when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from them, and <hi>then ſhall they faſt in thoſe days.</hi> And ſo I come to the Text.</p>
            <p>Wherein we may obſerve by the way</p>
            <p n="1">1. That Chriſt doth exempt his Diſciples from obſerving thoſe faſts that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples were in the practice of.<note place="margin">Chemnitiu Harm. in lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co.</note> And the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were obſerved, eſpecially on the <hi>Phariſees</hi> part, <hi>Ex ſimulato pietatis ſtudio,</hi> out of oſtentation of piety, and for ſelf-juſtification. As he did exempt them from their other traditions, ſo alſo from their faſts.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was to be taken away, which is to be underſtood of <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s fleſhly preſence, for his ſpiritual preſence never was, nor never will be taken away from his Church.</p>
            <p>And this preſence diſcontinues till his coming to judg the world, and then the cry will be heard at Midnight, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 25.6.</note> The <hi>Bridegroom</hi> that was once viſibly preſent on earth with his Diſciples, is ſo taken away that he will not be in that manner preſent with them again till his return from heaven.</p>
            <p>And his taking away doth either reſpect the acts of men, who by cruel hands <hi>took him from priſon, and from judgment, and nail'd him upon the croſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 53 8.</note> 
               <hi>and took him out of the Land of the living.</hi> Or elſe it reſpects the act of his
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:95740:131"/> Father, who took him up into heaven after he had finiſht his work here upon earth, as it is ſaid 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. <hi>ult. Received up into glory,</hi> which is the more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> though there is nothing in the original word to determine it to either ſenſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. He alſo declares what the practice of his Diſciples would be after his ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away. <hi>Then ſhall they faſt in thoſe days,</hi> ſo that he doth not deny the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Faſting</hi> to his Diſciples, but rather commends it, only it was not at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſeaſonable, as it afterwards would be.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> But why ſhould they faſt after he was taken away?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Some ſay, becauſe till then the Holy Ghoſt was not given in ſuch a degree as might fit them for ſuch extraordinary duties.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Chryſoſt.</note>As <hi>Chriſt</hi> ſeems to intimate, when upon this occaſion he excuſeth his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, as being not yet fit for ſuch ſpiritual ſervices. <hi>No man putteth a piece of new Cloth into an old garment, nor new wine into old bottles, Mark</hi> 2.22. It's true they might be able to keep faſt days as the Phariſees did; but <hi>Chriſt</hi> that va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues our duties by the frame of ſpirit exerted in them, would not have them put upon extraordinary duties till they had a ſuitable meaſure of the ſpirit to enable them thereunto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Others (and I think more properly) underſtand the words of Chriſt with reſpect to the afflictions and perſecutions that would come upon the Church after his aſcenſion into heaven; vvhich vvould give them great occaſions of prayer and extraordinary ſupplications, and vvhich vvould reduce them to ſuch great ſorrows and diſtreſſes, vvhereby faſting vvould be not only ſeaſonable, but that principle of grace that vvould act them in other duties, vvould alſo naturally lead them to it. Not to take up again the practice of theſe <hi>Phariſaical Faſts,</hi> (as <hi>the Montaniſts would hence infer</hi>) but the duty of <hi>Faſting</hi> as ſuited to <hi>Goſpel times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And theſe perſecutions began early. Firſt by the <hi>Jews,</hi> and then the <hi>Arrians,</hi> and then the <hi>Heathen perſecutions</hi> under the <hi>Dragon</hi> in the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and then under the <hi>Beaſt</hi> with the <hi>ſeven heads</hi> and <hi>ten horns,</hi> to whom the <hi>Dragon gave his ſeat and great power, Rev.</hi> 13.2. And Chriſt foretold this to his Diſciples be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he vvas taken away, <hi>That they that kil'd them would think they did God good ſervice, John</hi> 16.1. <hi>And that Nation ſhould riſe againſt Nation and Kingdom againſt Kingdom, and there ſhould be Famine, Peſtilence and Earthquakes,</hi> Mat. 14.7. <hi>Now in theſe days ſhould his Diſciples faſt.</hi> Not that in theſe vvords Chriſt doth give an inſtitution for faſting, but declares what eventually would come to paſs.</p>
            <p>Neither doth he determine any particular days and times for faſting, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly general during the abſence of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> they ſhould faſt in thoſe days. And indeed as ſoon as the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was gone they began to have cauſe of <hi>mourning:</hi> his abſence it ſelf was one great cauſe, as when he foretold them of it, <hi>ſorrow filled their hearts.</hi> And ſo upon ſeveral other cauſes of ſadneſs that ſhould fall out afterwards, there would be great occaſion of <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> till his coming again.</p>
            <p>Thus much for explication: And becauſe my ſubject is about faſting, I ſhall not conſider Chriſt in the relation of a Bridegroom as he is here ſtiled, of vvhich might be made a long diſcourſe, vvhich vvould rather lead me to ſpeak
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:95740:131"/> of <hi>Chriſtian Feſtivals</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual joy,</hi> than a <hi>religious Faſt,</hi> which is the <hi>ſubject</hi> I muſt attend unto.</p>
            <p>Neither need I make any logical diviſion of the Text. But inſtead thereof ſhall propoſe theſe three obſervations.</p>
            <p>Obſ. 1. <hi>There are ſome times that are more particular ſeaſons for Faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſ. 2. <hi>That Chriſtians ought wiſely to obſerve what is the proper duty of the times, and eſpecially when they are call'd to the great duty of a Faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſ. 3. <hi>That faſting is a duty to be practiſed in the days of the New Teſtament, even all the time of the Bridegroom's abſence. So that it is not a duty that was pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to the times of the</hi> Old Teſtament <hi>and the</hi> Moſaic poedagogy, <hi>but is to be practiſed in the Goſpel times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt I ſhall only inſiſt upon, and touch upon the other in the hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of it, vvherein I ſhall take notice, That Faſting may be conſidered ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as, <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Meerly natural.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Civil.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Religious.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As <hi>meerly natural,</hi> vvhich is only an abſtinence from food. As the <hi>Greek</hi> vvord, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a Faſt, <hi>Grammatically</hi> imports no more but a not <hi>eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Which may ariſe ſometimes from neceſſity and want of food, as vvhen the people followed <hi>Chriſt</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs,</hi> and continued three days there, and had nothing to eat; and hereupon Chriſt wrought a miracle to feed them, <hi>becauſe he would not ſend them away faſting, and they faint in the way, Mat.</hi> 15.32. So when <hi>Paul</hi> was in his Voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> for want of proviſion <hi>he and his compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny faſted fourteen days, Act.</hi> 27.33.</p>
            <p>Or elſe this <hi>natural faſt</hi> is through <hi>want of appetite,</hi> though food is preſent. There may be an <hi>Atrophy</hi> upon Nature, and man faſts only becauſe he cannot eat. Now this faſting is of no avail with God; if a man eats not, he is nothing the better, and if he eats, he is no whit the worſe. <hi>Bodily exerciſe profiteth nothing of it ſelf.</hi> As the Kingdom of God <hi>is not meats and drinks,</hi> ſo neither is it abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence from meats and drinks, eſpecially ſuch abſtinence as this that is not vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary, but upon neceſſity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Civil,</hi> when there is a faſting upon a civil account, with reſpect to ſome ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil end. As when the Magiſtrate doth impoſe abſtinence from meats for a while for ſome civil good.</p>
            <p>As <hi>Saul</hi> impoſed it upon the people in his purſuit of the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 14.</note> that his victory might not be hindred.</p>
            <p>And ſuch faſting ſometimes may be impoſed for the <hi>increaſe of proviſion,</hi> and for the <hi>publick health.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Religious.</hi> When faſting is attended with duties of religion, and is to ſome religious end. For the end doth in ſuch things as theſe ſpecifie and denominate the Action. And to give a particular Account of it, take it thus.</p>
            <p>A <hi>Religious Faſt</hi> is the devotion of the whole man to ſolemn extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry attendance upon God in a particular time ſeparated for that end, for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precating
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:95740:132"/> his diſpleaſure, and for the ſupplicating of his favour, joined with an <hi>abſtinence from bodily food,</hi> and other bodily delights, and from ſecular affairs. So that he that <hi>faſteth</hi> doth for that time ſeparate himſelf to God, and doth volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily <hi>dedicate</hi> a part of time to his more <hi>ſolemn ſervice;</hi> and doth put himſelf (as it were) under a <hi>Religious vow</hi> to abide ſolemnly with God in the duties of the <hi>faſt</hi> he is ingaged in.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Religious faſt</hi> is either publick or private.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Publick. As when a whole City <hi>faſts,</hi> as in the caſe of <hi>Nineveh;</hi> or a whole Nation, as in <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s caſe, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. who proclaimed a <hi>faſt</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all <hi>Judah.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Joel</hi> calls to ſuch a <hi>faſt, Joel</hi> 1.14. <hi>Sanctifie a faſt, call a ſolemn Aſſembly, gather the Elders, and all the Inhabitants of the Land into the Houſe of the Lord,</hi> &amp;c. when the occaſion is publick, ſo ought the faſt to be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Private. Which is either of a particular perſon, of which Chriſt ſpeaks, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.17, 18. <hi>But thou when thou faſte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, anoint thy head, waſh thy face, that thou appear not to men to faſt, but to thy Father in ſe ret, and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> And of this private <hi>faſt, Anna</hi> is an inſtance, of whom it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.37. <hi>That ſhe ſerved God in the temple with faſtings and prayers night and day:</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> another, who tells us, in three whole weeks he <hi>was mourning, did eat no pleaſant bread, neither came fleſh and wine into my mouth, Dan.</hi> 10.2, 3. And <hi>Cornelius</hi> is another, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.30. And the occaſion for private <hi>faſting</hi> is more peculiarly ſome private concerns, unleſs the perſon that <hi>faſts</hi> be a publick perſon, and then a private perſonal <hi>faſting</hi> may be upon a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick account as <hi>Daniels</hi> was.</p>
            <p>Or of a particular family, which the Apoſtle ſeems to ſpeak of, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. Where husband and wife, being of the ſame family, are adviſed by the Apoſtle not to defraud one another, <hi>but by conſent for a time to give themſelves to faſting and prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And when the Prophet <hi>Zachary</hi> ſpeaks of families mourning apart, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.13, 14. It may probably be meant of <hi>faſting</hi> join'd with <hi>mourning:</hi> And though the word <hi>family</hi> may be underſtood <hi>patronimically,</hi> and extend further than to a particular houſe, yet it may by <hi>Analogy</hi> be apply'd to particular houſes and the inhabitants therein.</p>
            <p>Again, a <hi>Religious faſt</hi> is either ſtated or occaſional.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Stated, as the <hi>faſt</hi> of the ſeventh month, and the tenth day of the month was a ſtated <hi>faſt</hi> to <hi>Iſrael</hi> every year, and the <hi>faſts</hi> the <hi>Jews</hi> obſerved in <hi>Babylon</hi> of the fourth, fifth, ſeventh, tenth month, mentioned <hi>Zach.</hi> 8.19. were ſtated <hi>faſts,</hi> and the <hi>Phariſee</hi> in the Goſpel boaſted of his ſtated <hi>faſting; I faſt twice in the week, Luke</hi> 19.12. Againſt which ſtated <hi>faſts,</hi> I have nothing to ſpeak, or to cenſure any mens practice herein, if the occaſion ſtill continues, and it do not degenerate into formality.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Occaſional, of which we have frequent inſtances, as the <hi>faſt</hi> obſerved by <hi>Eſther</hi> and her Maidens, and the Jews in <hi>Shuſhan</hi> was occaſional. And ſo that which I mentioned of <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> was occaſional. And the <hi>faſt</hi> in <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s time mentioned <hi>ch.</hi> 9.1. was occaſional. Theſe <hi>faſts</hi> did not paſs into any Stated courſe of obſervation.</p>

            <p>Having premiſed theſe diſtinctions, I ſhall diſcourſe of this religious <hi>faſt.</hi>

               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, for the <hi>Sanction</hi> of it. 1. It ſeems partly to be dictated by the light of nature, for the heathen obſerved it, eſpecially when any fore calamity was either felt or feared by them. As in the caſe of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> when <hi>Jonah</hi> denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced deſtruction to the City, they preſently betook themſelves to <hi>faſting,</hi> both King, Nobles, and People, yea, the very <hi>Beaſts</hi> muſt be concerned in it, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.7, 8. So when they would make their prayers more prevalent, in ſuch caſes they would join <hi>faſting</hi> with their prayers. As <hi>Baals</hi> Prieſts, when they cried to their God <hi>Baal</hi> to hear them. The Text ſaith, <hi>they cried all day until the evening ſacrifice,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.19. So that they did not only pray, but <hi>faſt</hi> alſo. As they uſed luſtrations, ſacrifices, feſtivals in their religious rites and worſhip of their Gods, ſo ſometimes they had their <hi>Jejunia,</hi> and religious <hi>faſts.</hi> As we have ſome account of this in <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Book <hi>adverſus Phychicos.</hi> By which they thought to make ſome ſatisfaction for their ſin, and to reconcile to themſelves the Deity they had offended, or to obtain ſome ſpecial favour they had need of.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is a duty by <hi>Inſtitution,</hi> and that both in the Old and New Teſtament, the <hi>faſt</hi> of the ſeventh month was by direct inſtitution in the Old Teſtament. And at other times God call'd them to it. <hi>Sanctifie a faſt, call an Aſſembly</hi> (ſaid the Prophet <hi>Joel) chap.</hi> 1.14. And God is ſaid to <hi>chooſe</hi> it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. <hi>Is not this the faſt that I have choſen?</hi> And God's declaring there in that Chapter the right way of obſerving it, doth prove the duty it ſelf to be of his own appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>And the New Teſtament requires it alſo, for the duty is of a <hi>Moral</hi> nature, and therefore the obligation of it remains, only with this difference.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are not to uſe thoſe rites and outward expreſſions of ſorrow that were practiced in thoſe times; which belonged to the rigour of that legal miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion As <hi>Rending the garment, Joel</hi> 2.13. <hi>putting on of ſackcloth, Neh.</hi> 9.1. <hi>covering with Aſhes, Dan.</hi> 9.3. <hi>bowing down the head, Iſa.</hi> 58.5. <hi>Putting earth upon their head, Neh.</hi> 9.1. and ſometimes <hi>putting off their ſandal, or ſhoes, and plucking off the hair, Ezra</hi> 9.3. and <hi>making themſelves bald, Iſa.</hi> 22.12. And the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſees uſed <hi>diſfiguring</hi> of their faces, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. But ſaith Chriſt to his Diſciples, <hi>when thou faſteſt anoint thy head, waſh thy face,</hi> which in their <hi>faſting</hi> the Jews ſhould forbear, though uſed at other times, as appears by <hi>Daniels faſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, chap.</hi> 10.3. <hi>I ate no pleaſant bread, neither did I anoint my ſelf at all.</hi> But ſaith Chriſt, do not ye do ſo, but anoint thy head, and waſh thy face, &amp;c. and ſo uſe not ſuch viſible ſigns of ſorrow, that thou may'ſt not <hi>appear to men to faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We ought not to faſt with that legal frame of ſpirit which was upon the Jews in thoſe days, for every duty in the days of the New Teſtament is to
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:95740:133"/> be managed with a ſpirit ſuiting the Goſpel miniſtration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to its <hi>ſanction,</hi> there may be alſo the addition of humane authority in the appointing of faſts, eſpecially publick faſts, when the publick ſtate of affairs may require it, the duty in general being of God's inſtitution, and the voice of Providence calling people to it, the Magiſtrate in this caſe may determine the time, if it be general to a Nation. Or the Paſtors and guides of the Church with reſpect to the ſeveral Churches over which they preſide. For where a duty is required of God, and the circumſtance of time not determin'd, <hi>there</hi> Chriſtian prudence in Magiſtrates or Churches is to be the rule for determination. As the particular times for <hi>Baptiſm</hi> and the <hi>Lord's Supper</hi> are left to Chriſtian prudence to determine.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The manner how a <hi>religious faſt</hi> is to be obſerved.</p>
            <p>And that both with reſpect to the <hi>outward</hi> and <hi>inward</hi> man.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <note place="margin">And if ſome cannot hear a total abſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nence, ſome courſer food may be uſed, as in <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s time they had their Xe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rophagiae, ſo called from a dry kind of food uſed by them. <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> de jejun. adv Pſithicos.</note>1. With reſpect to the <hi>outward man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Abſtinence from food is requiſite and neceſſary ſo far as may conſiſt with mercy to the body. For the very name of a faſt implies this abſtinence, and not only the <hi>Jews</hi> but the very <hi>Heathen</hi> in their faſts did injoin this abſtinence upon themſelves and others, as appears by that of <hi>Nineveh, Jonah</hi> 2.7.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As alſo <hi>meaner apparel</hi> than what may be uſed at other times, though not to put on Sackcloth, yet to lay aſide ornaments and richer dreſſes upon ſuch a day.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> would expreſs their ſorrow for the ſad tidings of God's refuſing to go before them. It is ſaid, they laid aſide their Ornaments, <hi>Exodus</hi> 33.4.</p>
            <p>Though they had a command for it, yet <hi>nature</hi> it ſelf did teach it them. As it did the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> who laid aſide his robe when he faſted and mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>Purple and ſcarlet and ſhining apparel are not ſuitable to ſuch a duty, <hi>nature</hi> it ſelf being judg.</p>
            <q>Non eſt conveniens luctibus ille color.</q>
            <p>And verily thoſe gay and gaudy dreſſes which multitudes garb themſelves with at this day, are no whit ſuitable to the ſad times upon which God hath caſt us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Yea, and <hi>humble geſtures</hi> alſo, which may beſt expreſs a ſolemn ſerious mind. Though no particular geſture is abſolutely commanded, yet nothing ought to be diſcovered either in the countenance or any actions and geſtures of the body that may be unſuitable to the nature of the day, and the ſolemn duties thereof; wherein partly the light of nature, and the cuſtom of the place may di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and regulate us.</p>
            <p>The Jews had three ſorts of geſtures that were uſed in worſhip.</p>
            <p>The one was bowing the head, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>The other was bending the knee, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>The third was proſtration of the body, call'd <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>
            </p>
            <p>But where there is no particular geſture determined there Chriſtians are left to their liberty, only it is to be guided by a due reſpect to the greateſt
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:95740:133"/> advantage of the duty, and with caution againſt any juſt offence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Abſtinence from ſecular affairs is requiſite, for a faſt is a ſolemn devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a certain part of time to God, and to an extraordinary attendance upon him. And if meats and drinks are to be forborn, for to give advantage to the duties of the day, ſo alſo bodily labours and ſecular buſineſs upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh faſts were reckoned among their Sabbaths, and ſo they were days of reſt from bodily labours.</p>
            <p>And there was a ſevere puniſhment to be inflicted upon the men that did any work upon their ſolemn faſts of the tenth day of the ſeventh month, as we read <hi>Levit.</hi> 23.30. <hi>The ſame ſoul will I deſtroy from among his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though the rigour of that legal miniſtration is abated under the Goſpel, yet it holds ſtill in the moral and equitable part of it, that whatever may hinder the managing of any duty in that manner that is ſuitable and neceſſary there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto ought to be laid aſide; but</p>
            <p n="5">5. To theſe I ſhall here add the external duties of religion, and ſacred ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances to be uſed in the diſcharge of the work of the day.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is <hi>confeſſion of ſin,</hi> a faſt day is for atonement, and therefore confeſſion of ſin is neceſſary. As we read of <hi>Ezra</hi> when he heard of the ſin of the Jews in their making <hi>affinity</hi> with the people of the Land, <hi>he rent his garment and ſat aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied till the evening ſacrifice, and made confeſſion of their ſin, Ezra</hi> 9.7, 8, 9, 10.</p>
            <p>So in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9.1, 2. we read the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were aſſembled with faſting, and they ſtood and <hi>confeſſed their ſins,</hi> and the <hi>iniquities of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> in his ſolemn faſt, which he ſet himſelf to in the behalf of the Captivity now almoſt expired, he makes an ample confeſſion of ſin, as we read <hi>Dan</hi> 9.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>And as a faſt is an extraordinary duty, ſo confeſſion of ſin ought to be more than ordinary in ſuch a day, and what may ſuffice at another time, may not be ſufficient then. It ought to be more extenſive with reſpect to the ſeveral <hi>kinds</hi> and acts of ſin, with reſpect to the aggravations of ſin, and with reſpect to the perſons that are under guilt, and with reſpect to the inward principles of ſin in the heart, out of which all actual ſins do ſpring. As <hi>Daniels</hi> confeſſion of ſin extended to the kinds of it, the ſeveral aggravations of it, and to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that were concern'd in it, as their Kings, Princes, Fathers, people of the Land, thoſe that were near, and thoſe that were far off, as we find in that chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And this confeſſion of ſin is requiſite to the deeper humiliation of the ſoul, to the condemnation of our ſelves; and to the juſtifying of God, whereby he may have the greater glory.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is <hi>ſupplication,</hi> which is the imploring mercy from God, either with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the pardon of ſin committed, or the preventing thoſe judgments that are impending, or the removing ſuch as are inflicted. As we find <hi>Daniel</hi> in the time of his faſting, after his confeſſion, made earneſt ſupplications for <hi>forgiveneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of ſin, v.</hi> 9. <hi>for the turning away God's anger and fury, v.</hi> 16. <hi>for the ſhining of his face upon his ſanctuary, v.</hi> 17. <hi>for the repairing the deſolations of their City call'd by his name, v.</hi> 18. and for the people in <hi>general, ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="256" facs="tcp:95740:134"/>
            <p>And therefore <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer</hi> are frequently mentioned together in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.37. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.30. <hi>Acts</hi> 14.23, 24. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.5. though prayer in general comprehends confeſſion and thankſgiving in it, as well as ſupplication, yet in a ſtricter acceptation, petition for mercy doth moſt properly expreſs the import of the word and the main matter of the duty.</p>
            <p>And this the King of <hi>Nineveh</hi> enjoined in the faſt appointed by him, <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.8. <hi>Let man and beat be covered with ſackcloath, and cry mightily to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that ſupplication and crying to God is another great part of the duty of the day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Hearing the word,</hi> for the word is neceſſary both for the diſcovery of ſin for our preſent humiliation, and for the diſcovery of our duty with reſpect to future reformation, both which are neceſſary to an acceptable faſt. And the word of the Goſpel ſets before men a door of hope, that their ſin may be par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and judgment removed. It preſents God not only as reconcileable, but delighting in mercy; It ſets before men many inſtances of God's h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aring prayer, and the prevalency of repentance and humiliation with him. And par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly what acceptance ſolemn faſting hath found with him in ſeveral ages. And all this mightily tends to the furthering the great duties of the day. And it is obſerved of the faſt kept by the children of <hi>Iſrael, Nehem.</hi> 9.3. that they read in the book of the Law of the Lord their God <hi>one fourth part of the day,</hi> and another fourth part they confeſſed and worſhipped; if repentance, ſpiritual mourning, and ſoul humiliation be neceſſary to the day, as I ſhall ſhew pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, then the hearing the word may be of great uſe thereunto: As when <hi>Joſiah</hi> heard the words of the Law, he rent his cloaths and humbled himſelf, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 34.27. and <hi>Ahab</hi> upon the like occaſion humbled himſelf, though not in the like manner; and we read how God appointed <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> and <hi>Jeremiah Baruch</hi> to read the roll that was written from the mouth of God, in the ears of the people upon their faſting day, <hi>Jer.</hi> 36.6. and what was the cauſe of <hi>Ninevehs</hi> repentance and humiliation, was it not <hi>Jonah</hi>'s preaching? as our Saviour ſpeaks of it, <hi>Math.</hi> 12.41. <hi>They repented at the preaching of Jonah,</hi> though his preaching was only this, yet <hi>forty days and Nineveh ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> The word is effectual through Chriſt to bring the impenitent to repentance, and to renew the exerciſe of repentance in thoſe that have already repented; which is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per work for a faſt day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Renewing our Covenant with God, which in private faſts is to be done betwixt God and a man's own ſoul, and in publick faſts by the mouth of the preacher, and the peoples conſent thereunto.</p>
            <p>And this Covenant is either the general Covenant that we renew, or elſe a particular Covenant, with reſpect to ſome particular duties that we ingage our ſelves unto: Or elſe both together. As in the publick faſt obſerved by the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Nehem.</hi> 9. both Princes and Nobles and people re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed their general Covenant to walk in God's Law, which was given by <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord, and particularly they covenanted not to give their Daughters to the people of the Land, nor take their Daughters for their Sons, as we read <hi>Nehemiah Chap.</hi> 10. <hi>ver.</hi> 19, 20. and the Covenant being written, their Princes, Levites and Prieſts did ſeal to it. So if a Church
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:95740:134"/> or people have contracted guilt upon themſelves by the omitting of ſome du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or the committing of any ſins, for which the Lord may have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie with them. It is a proper work upon a day of <hi>faſting</hi> to ingage themſelves to a reformation by a ſolemn renewing their Covenant with God.</p>
            <p>And though we have not a <hi>particular Inſtance</hi> of this in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> yet the <hi>Law</hi> of ſaith that requires men now to take hold of <hi>God's Covenant,</hi> and in all caſes to make uſe of it, ſo in ſome ſpecial caſes to renew it alſo. Not that it needs renewing as to the ſubſtance or ſanction of it on God's part, but we are on our part to renew it with God, by laying new ingagements and obligations upon our ſelves to carry it in all things according to the Law of this covenant in the reſtipulating part of it.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The next duty of the day is Thankſgiving. Though this ſeems not the proper duty of the day, yet is not to be omitted, for the due conſideration of God's mercy tends to the aggravation of ſin, and ſo to make mens confeſſions and humiliations more affectionate and evangelical. As in that faſt I mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before, <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. The <hi>Levites</hi> did ſtand up among the people, and begin the day with bleſſing God. <hi>Bleſſed be thy glorious name, which is exalted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all bleſſing and praiſe, ver.</hi> 5. and ſo they proceed to recite a catalogue of God's mercies, even from the firſt call of <hi>Abraham,</hi> to their ſettlement in the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> which reacheth to <hi>ver.</hi> 25. And all this was to bring in the <hi>Nevertheleſs</hi> mention'd <hi>v.</hi> 26. with the greater <hi>Emphaſis</hi> to their humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, <hi>Nevertheleſs they were diſobedient, and rebelled againſt thee, and caſt thy Law behind their backs, and ſhew thy Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. and the ſame we may obſerve in <hi>Ezra, chap.</hi> 9. He takes notice of the reviving God had given them in their bondage, and the Nail in his holy place, and the Wall in <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem, ver.</hi> 8, 9. the more to aggravate the peoples ſin in doing according to the abominations of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> and mingling themſelves with the people of the Land, <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. The goodneſs of God is ſaid <hi>to lead men to Repentance,</hi> Rom. 2. And therefore mention is to be made of it upon a day when the exerciſe of Repentance is ſpecially in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>Yea, Thankſgiving alſo is requiſite as an attendant of ſupplication, for the giving thanks for mercy received is an effectual way to obtain New mercy: According to that known ſaying, <hi>Efficaciſſimum genus rogandi eſt gratias agere.</hi> Giving thanks for mercy received, is the moſt effectual way to obtain new mercy.</p>
            <p>Thankſgiving carries ſupplication in the ſpirit of it. And if according to the Apoſtle, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. We are <hi>in every thing to make known our requeſt with ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and thankſgiving,</hi> then when ever we come to God with Supplications, we are to couple them with thankſgiving.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The laſt duty I mention, which is the Appendix to the reſt, is that of <hi>Alms-deeds,</hi> for when we come to beg mercy from God we ſhould not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get to ſhew it to men. And he that ſtops his ear to the cry of the poor,<note place="margin">Prov. 21.13.</note> 
               <hi>he may cry but ſhall not be heard;</hi> yea, his prayers are ſo far from coming up as <hi>incenſe</hi> before God, that they are an abomination. <hi>Cornelius</hi> that was a man much in prayer and <hi>faſting</hi> alſo, as is noted of him, <hi>Act.</hi> 10.30. was full alſo of <hi>Alms-deeds,
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:95740:135"/> Act.</hi> 10.31. and both together came up as a <hi>memorial before God. Alms-deeds</hi> as they are not to be confined to a faſt day, ſo ſurely are not to be excluded. He that vvill on ſuch a day ſhut up his purſe, let him take heed leaſt God ſhut up againſt him his ear his heart and his hand. The People complain, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.8. <hi>Wherefore have we faſted and thou ſeeſt not?</hi> God tells them they faſted, but ſhewed not mercy; and therefore faſted not aright: and then tells them what was the faſt that he had choſen, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. <hi>Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and when thou ſeeſt the naked that thou cover them,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Certainly thoſe duties that ought to follow our faſting, or elſe it avails no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing with God, ought not to be ſhut out of the duties of ſuch a day, if there be call and opportunity thereunto.</p>
            <p>Thus I have ſhewn the duties of a faſt day, which are external, with reſpect to the <hi>outward performance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And next I ſhall ſhew what <hi>frame of ſpirit</hi> is requiſite to ſuch a day, without which all theſe duties may be externally performed, and yet the faſt not accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.<note place="margin">Rom. 2. <hi>ult.</hi>
               </note> For as the Apoſtle ſaith of Circumciſion, <hi>It is that of the heart, and of the ſpirit,</hi> ſo is that faſting that is well pleaſing to God. There may be <hi>confeſſion, ſupplication, renewing the Covenant, Thanksgiving, Alms-deeds,</hi> and yet if there be wanting a ſuitable frame of heart, all this may be but as a body without the ſoul, or matter without form, that may have praiſe with men, but none with God.</p>
            <p>Now this frame of ſoul conſiſts in, <list>

            <p>I ſhall ſpeak briefly to them all.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is <hi>ſelf-debaſement.</hi> God complains of the <hi>Jews faſting, Iſa.</hi> 58.5. they did <hi>hang down their heads like a bulruſh,</hi> but their ſouls did not bow down within them. We call a <hi>faſt day</hi> a <hi>day of humiliation,</hi> but we have the name but not the thing, if the ſoul be not humbled: What is it for the body to wear ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, if Pride cover the heart; or to ſpread aſhes under us, if the ſoul lye not down in the duſt, or to faſt from bodily food, if the ſoul be not emptied of ſelf-fulneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Godly ſorrow.</hi> A <hi>faſt day</hi> is for afflicting the ſoul, and how is the ſoul affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted without true ſorrow? The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> that ſignifies a <hi>faſt,</hi> is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from a root that ſignifies to afflict, ſo eſſential is the afflicting the ſoul to the day. It was a charge againſt the <hi>Jews, Iſa.</hi> 58.2. Behold in the day of your <hi>faſt</hi> ye find pleaſure. What kind of pleaſure it was, is not there mentioned, but it was ſome ſinful pleaſure that was not congruous to the day. <hi>Daniel</hi> ſpeaks of his <hi>faſt, ch.</hi> 10.3. <hi>I ſat full three weeks mourning.</hi> As at our funerals, many enter the <hi>houſe of mourning</hi> and wear black, but there is no mourning within, nor no garment of heavineſs covers their ſoul.</p>
            <pb n="259" facs="tcp:95740:135"/>
            <p>So do many enter the day and duty of <hi>faſting,</hi> but no godly ſorrow enters with them into it, or attends them in it. Every thing is beautiful in its ſeaſon, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 3.11. A <hi>faſt day</hi> wants its beauty if no true ſorrow attends it.</p>
            <p>We make confeſſion of ſin, but if there be no ſorrow, we feel not what is ſpoken, and what will words of confeſſion avail? <hi>Ephraim</hi> is ſaid to <hi>bemoan himſelf, Jer.</hi> 31.18. And God is ſaid to hear it, and he bemoaned him alſo; But how can we think God's heart ſhould be affected with our confeſſions, when our own are not. The <hi>Jews</hi> upon their ſolemn days had their ſolemn ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices. A <hi>faſt</hi> day is a ſolemn day, and it is not to be without its ſacrifices, and the great Sacrifice or Sacrifices of the day, is a broken and contrite ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.<note place="margin">pſal. 51.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Filial fear.</hi> Natural fear hath ſometimes brought a people to the duty, and a filial fear is to be exerciſed in the performance of it, as <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> feared, and then proclaimed a <hi>Faſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. And ſo did the King of <hi>Nineveh, Jonah</hi> 2. when God's judgments are abroad we ought to fear, and this fear ſhould lead us to meet him in the ways of his judgment by prayer and faſting, for all our ſerving God is to be <hi>coupled with fear, Pſal.</hi> 2.11. our rejoycing is to be with trembling, much more our mourning.</p>
            <p>In a <hi>faſt</hi> day we eſpecially deprecate God's wrath, and therefore we ought to have ſuch a ſenſe of it, as may cauſe ſacred fear. There is no affection of the ſoul but ought to be ſanctified to the ſervice and honour of God, and ſo fear among the reſt, and is then to be exerciſed when we draw nigh to God, eſpecially in the ſolemn duties of a <hi>faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Ingenuous ſhame.</hi> Sin is in it ſelf a <hi>ſhameful</hi> thing, and therefore when it is confeſſed upon a ſolemn day, it ought to be with ſhame. As <hi>Ezra</hi> hearing of the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> after their return from their captivity, <hi>he ſate aſtonied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till the Evening,</hi> and then riſeth up, and rends the mantle, and ſpeaks to God: <hi>O my God I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my faee unto thee, Ezra</hi> 9.5. <hi>And to us belongeth confuſion of face,</hi> ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> in his <hi>faſting, Dan.</hi> 9.8. Two things cauſe ſhame. One is to act contrary to our own reaſon, an I the other is, to act unſuitably to another's kindneſs. The one is abſurd, and the other is diſingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and both may cauſe ſhame. And there are both theſe in ſin, eſpecially when committed with allowance, for right reaſon doth condemn it, and it is a high violation of the law of kindneſs, to return evil where we receive all our good.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Inward purity,</hi> by which I mean not a total freedom from ſin, but a freedom from a corrupt end, and the ſecret allowance of ſin in our <hi>faſting.</hi> Either of theſe will ſpoil the <hi>faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. A corrupt end; As the <hi>Phariſees</hi> who <hi>faſted</hi> to appear religious before men. And the <hi>Jews</hi> in <hi>Babylon</hi> who <hi>faſted,</hi> but <hi>did ye faſt to me, even to me?</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Zach.</hi> 7.5. their end was not right.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A ſecret allowance of ſin, this made the <hi>Jews faſting</hi> of no avail with God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 14.10. <hi>They have loved to wander.</hi> There is their allowance of ſin, <hi>And when they faſt I will not hear their cry, ver.</hi> 12. There their <hi>faſt</hi> turns to no account. It is ſaid of <hi>Ahab, he rent his cloaths, put on ſackcloth and faſted,</hi> 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.27. But ſtill he kept faſt his ſin, and ſo not accepted. As when the Jews came to enquire of God, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 14. God tells them, <hi>he well
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:95740:136"/> not be enquired of by them.</hi> And why? becauſe they ſet up Idols in their heart <hi>v.</hi> 7. ſo if men come to God by <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>prayer,</hi> and have in their hearts an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance of ſin, (which God the ſearcher of hearts can know,) they bring an Idol along with them in their hearts, and their <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>faſting</hi> are rejected of him. <hi>David</hi> well knew this, when he ſaith, <hi>If I regard iniquity in mine heart, God will not hear my prayer:</hi> Though men while they are <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> are not viſibly acting ſin, yet God ſeeth the aſpect of the ſoul, if that be looking to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſin with pleaſure and delight (as that Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> there im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports) the prayer is rejected.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Si j'euſſe pentè quelque malice, &amp;c.</note>Or if we read the words as the <hi>French Tranſlation</hi> (I think more properly) renders them. If I had regarded ſome wickedneſs in my heart, God would not have heard my prayer; the ſence is the ſame to my preſent pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Evangelical Faith and Hope in God.</hi> All our confeſſions and humiliations and ſupplications ought to be joined with faith in Chriſt, and hope in God's mercies, or elſe they want the great Ingredients of their acceptableneſs with God. As in <hi>Ezra</hi>'s <hi>faſt, Shechaniah</hi> ſtands up and ſaith to him, <hi>we have treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed againſt our God, and taken ſtrange wives,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Yet there is hope in Iſrael concerning this thing,</hi> Ezra 10.2. <hi>And to the Lord our God belong mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and forgiveneſſes,</hi> ſaid <hi>Daniel</hi> in his <hi>faſting, Dan.</hi> 9.9. God's mercy and Chriſt's merits ſhould bear up our faith and hope, while our ſin is caſting us down with ſorrow. As <hi>Samuel</hi> endeavoured to bring the people, firſt to a ſenſe of their ſin in their chooſing a <hi>King,</hi> and then bears up their <hi>faith</hi> and <hi>hope,</hi> by telling them <hi>God will not forſake his people for his name ſake,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 22.22. and <hi>David</hi> while he was confeſſing his ſins of <hi>adultery</hi> and <hi>murther, Pſal.</hi> 51. yet ſtileth God <hi>the God of his Salvation, ver.</hi> 14. and whiles he was crying to God out of the <hi>depths,</hi> as he ſpeaks, and making his ſupplication, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 130.1, 2. yet he joins therewith faith and hope in God's mercy, <hi>ver.</hi> 4. <hi>But there is forgiveneſs with thee that thou mayeſt be feared.</hi> All our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, even our <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>humiliations</hi> ought to be perform'd <hi>Evangelical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> which cannot be except faith and hope do accompany the performance of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I next proceed to ſpeak of the ſpecial occaſions that call us to this <hi>religious faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Is the affliction and diſtreſs of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When the <hi>Jews</hi> were in great diſtreſs, then <hi>Eſther</hi> appointed <hi>Mordecai</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> to <hi>faſt, Eſther</hi> 4.16.</p>
            <p>When the <hi>Ammonites</hi> and <hi>Moabites</hi> invaded <hi>Judah</hi> with a great Army, then <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> proclaimed a <hi>faſt,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.3. When a great famine was upon the land of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> then ſaid the Prophet <hi>Joel, ch.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Sanctifie a faſt, call a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn aſſembly.</hi> And when the <hi>Jews</hi> were in <hi>Babylon,</hi> then they kept their <hi>faſt</hi> of the 4th 5th 7th and 10th month, all the time of their captivity though the ſeveral months had reſpect to ſome particular calamities that befel them in thoſe months. <hi>Sympathy</hi> and <hi>ſorrow</hi> are naturally expreſt by <hi>faſting;</hi> and are ſpiritually to be expreſt with reſpect to the Churches diſtreſs by a <hi>Religious faſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Upon the occaſion of extraordinary ſin: If in a particular family it may be
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:95740:136"/> a juſt occaſion for a faſt in the family, if in a particular Church, or in a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it may be an occaſion of a more <hi>publick faſt.</hi> As the faſt of <hi>Ezra chap.</hi> 9. and of <hi>Nehemiah chap.</hi> 9. was upon the occaſion of the ſin of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in making marriages with the people of the Land. And <hi>Hezekiah rent his clothes, and covered himſelf with ſackcloth,</hi> and went into the houſe of the Lord up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion of <hi>Rabſhakehs</hi> reproaching and blaſpheming God, as well as the diſtreſs that was upon himſelf and the people by <hi>Senacheribs</hi> invaſion, as we read <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. beginning. We ſhould mourn over the diſhonour done to God, as well as any diſtreſs and trouble that may come upon our ſelves, and we read of the <hi>Congregation of Iſrael</hi> weeping before the <hi>door of the Tabernacle,</hi> upon the account of the whoredom committed by many of them with the Daughters of <hi>Moab,</hi> and <hi>bowing down to their Gods,</hi> Numbers 25.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>For the obtaining ſome eminent mercy, or for ſucceſs in any great undertakings and enterprizes.</hi> As <hi>Eſther</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eſther 4.11.</note> before ſhe went in to the King to beg for the lives of her People, ſhe required her <hi>Maidens, Mordecai</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> to faſt. And <hi>Ezra</hi> proclaimed a faſt to ſeek a right way from God, for themſelves, their little ones and all their ſubſtance, when they were coming out of the Captivity to ſettle in their own Land, <hi>Ezra</hi> 8.21. When <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> were ſent forth to their more publick Miniſtry, certain Prophets faſted and pray'd, and laid hands on them, and ſent them away, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.3. and when they ordained Elders for the Churches, they commended them to the Lord <hi>with prayer and faſting, Acts</hi> 14.23.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>For Conqueſt over ſome eminent Temptation.</hi> This may be the occaſion of a private faſt, when a private perſon lies under it, or of a more publick faſt, if the temptation reacheth further. As Chriſt ſpeaks of ſome kind of Devils that are not caſt out but by Faſting and Prayer: And the Rule may reach to Soul-temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, as well as bodily poſſeſſions, whereof our Saviour there ſpeaks. But I haſten.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I ſhall next ſpeak of the concern that abſtinence from food hath in the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a faſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That hereby the ſoul may be more fit for its operations;<note place="margin">Jejunium purgat men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>blevat ſenſum, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem ſpiritui ſubjicit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupiſcentiae nebulas diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pergit; as <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaks of it. Tom. 10. Ser. 230. de Temp.</note> the pampering and feeding the body is uſually injurious to the free exerciſe of the ſoul. And therefore the chaſtening it with due faſting may befriend the ſoul therein, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in ſuch exerciſes wherein the ſoul is to have leaſt communion with the body.</p>
            <p>As the body ought not to be robbed for the ſerving of God of that which is neceſſary for it; for God hates robbery for ſacrifice, ſo by undue providing for it, we may rob the ſoul, and rob God of that ſervice which it ought to perform unto him.</p>
            <p>The body is call'd by Philoſophers <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or <hi>bruta pars hominis,</hi> the brute part of man. And a brute is not ſo fit for man's ſervice, if he be kept ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at too high or too low a rate, <hi>nec ſuprà negotium, nec infrâ negotium, ſed par negotio,</hi> is a good rule for the body to be treated by; and as <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> ſpeaks, abſtinence from food upon a ſolemn faſt is requiſit <hi>ob elevatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem mentis,</hi> for the elevation of the mind, that it may get looſe from the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive part, and ſo more freely aſcend to things above. As the Apoſtle kept
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:95740:137"/> his body in ſubjection, that he might with more freedom run the race to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the <hi>Crown that is incorruptible,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.26, 27. Severity to the body may in ſome caſes be mercy to the ſoul.</p>
            <p>As <hi>David</hi> chaſtened his ſoul with <hi>faſting, Pſal.</hi> 69.10. It was its ſenſitive part he immediately chaſtned, that the rational and intellectual part might be more vigorous and active.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In this <hi>bodily abſtinence</hi> there is ſomething of a <hi>ſelf-judging</hi> in it: for by abſtaining for a while we judg our ſelves unworthy of returning to ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhings and comforts of nature at all. We are by abſtaining from food to reckon our ſelves unworthy of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By it we alſo expreſs our ſympathy with the Churches ſufferings, I mean in thoſe faſts that are kept upon that account. And nature ſeems to teach men this: as when <hi>David</hi> would have had <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah</hi> go to his own houſe when he was come from the Camp;<note place="margin">2 Sam. 11.11.</note> he anſwered, <hi>The Ark and</hi> Iſrael <hi>and</hi> Judah <hi>are incamped in the open field, ſhall I thou go to my houſe, and eat and drink,</hi> &amp;c. As by eating and drinking we expreſs our gladneſs, ſo by abſtaining we properly expreſs our ſorrow and <hi>ſympathy</hi> with others ſuffering. Whiles <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi>'s child lay ſick, he faſted and would eat nothing, but when the child was dead,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12.20.</note> he then would declare his ſhaking off his ſorrow by <hi>calling for food and eating.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, I ſhall ſpeak of the abuſe of a <hi>religious faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this great <hi>Ordinance</hi> is ſeveral ways abuſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is a <hi>Phariſaical</hi> abuſe of it by oſtentation.</p>
            <p>When men faſt to put on a diſguiſe of extraordinary devotion and ſanctity, as the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did thus; and by disfiguring their faces and counterfeiting a ſolemn and dejected countenance, and by mortified habits, &amp;c. did ſeek to gain the reputation of extraordinary holineſs among the people. As the <hi>Phariſee</hi> in the parable among other things boaſted of his often faſting, <hi>I faſt twice a week.</hi> Strict piety hath ſuch a real value in it, that ſome that have it not, yet will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, as thinking to advance their reputation by it.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 21.</note>2. There is a miſchievous abuſe of it, (if I may ſo expreſs it) when mens hearts are full of malice, miſchief and cruelty, and will hide it under the diſguiſe of a <hi>religious faſt.</hi> As <hi>Jezebel</hi> when ſhe was deſigning againſt <hi>Naboth</hi>'s vineyard, and life alſo, ſhe proclaims a faſt; and thoſe <hi>Jews</hi> that are reproved, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 58. they faſted and faſted, but it was <hi>for ſtrife and debate, and to ſmite with the fiſt of wickedneſs.</hi> They oppreſt the poor, laid heavy yokes upon their necks, and ruined them by their cruelties, and yet were very zealous faſters, as our Saviour ſpeaks of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> who made long prayers for a pretence <hi>while they were devouring widows houſes, Math.</hi> 23.14.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a formal abuſe of it, when men have not ſuch ſinful ends as I mentioned, but yet reſt in the externals of the day, and care not to reach the ſpiritual part of the duty. They go along with the ſeveral duties of the day; but <hi>deeſt aliquid intùs:</hi> there is that wanting within that is the proper work of the day. <hi>They ſit before God as his people,</hi> as if they were humbling themſelves before him,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> but there is nothing in their hearts that anſwers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to the outward ſhew they make before men. Religious duties ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Scripture-language are not done, if not done aright: ſo that as
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:95740:137"/> the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> tells the <hi>Corinthians, This is not to eat the Lord's ſupper,</hi> becauſe they did not eat aright, ſo when men are formal in <hi>faſting,</hi> this is not keeping a <hi>faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. There is a Popiſh abuſe of it,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By groundleſs <hi>faſting,</hi> as on the <hi>veſpers</hi> of their Saints days, and their <hi>Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drageſima's,</hi> faſting the holy time of <hi>Lent,</hi> in imitation of <hi>Chriſt's faſting</hi> in the <hi>wilderneſs</hi> which was miraculous, and ſo not imitable.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By making faſting meritorious, and that which is part of ſatisfactory pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance for the expiation of ſin, as <hi>Aquinas</hi> ſpeaks expreſly, faſting is to be uſed <hi>ad ſatisfaciendum pro peccatis,</hi> to make ſatisfaction for ſin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By their prohibition of certain meats which God hath <hi>commanded to be received with thanksgiving,</hi> and yet allowing others in their room,<note place="margin">Aquin. 22. Q. 147. Art. 1. They forbid Carnes, ova &amp; lacticinia, but all ſorts of fiſh and other vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nds and junkets are allowed. <hi>Aquin.</hi> 22. <hi>Q.</hi> 148. Art. 8.</note> which are as inconſiſtent with the abſtinence of a true faſt; as thoſe that their Church pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits, but yet they have the ſalve of a diſpenſation in ſuch caſes, and if men will open their purſes, they may gratifie their palats.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Laſtly, faſting may be abuſed by too frequent uſe, eſpecially publick faſts. It is an extraordinary duty, and therefore not to be practiſed upon ordinary occaſions. The too ordinary uſe of it may take off from the reverence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity of the duty. We find the ſeveral publick faſts upon record in Scripture were taken up upon ſome eminent occaſions.</p>
            <p>And beſides it may make Religion burdenſom; and weak converts may be diſcouraged that are already brought in: And thoſe that are <hi>without,</hi> may be prejudiced and hindred. We ſhould not make Chriſt's yoke heavier than he would have it. Chriſt did not impoſe the rigour of the legal miniſtration upon his Diſciples, nor the burthenſom traditions of the Phariſees: nor did himſelf practice the <hi>auſterity</hi> uſed by <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, nor impoſed it upon his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.</p>
            <p>Thus I have run through the five particulars I propoſed to diſcourſe this ſubject in.</p>
            <p>And upon the whole ſhall make ſome practical uſe.</p>
            <p>

It reproves ſuch who inſtead of <hi>prayer</hi> and <hi>faſting</hi> when required of them, give up themſelves to all <hi>exceſs of riot,</hi> who make <hi>their belly their God,</hi> ſo far they are from denying it for the ſervice of God, who practiſe as it was ſaid of <hi>Iſrael</hi> in caſe of the golden Calf, <hi>The people ſate down to eat and to drink, and roſe up to play:</hi> And ſay according to this licentious <hi>Proverb</hi> quoted by the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> out of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> 22.13. <hi>Let us eat and drink for to morrow we muſt dye.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though God be viſiting the world with his judgments, daſhing the nations like potters veſſels, one againſt another: yet they care for none of theſe things; they are loth ſo far to own God as to faſt and pray under his rebukes; and their ſpirits are too high to ſtoop to the humbling duties of ſuch a day, becauſe <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> have been abuſed, it may be by ſome in hypocriſie, they are glad of that excuſe to lay it quite aſide.</p>
            <p>The Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> they value above all Scripture becauſe of two or three verſes they find therein, that they can interpret to gratifie a ſenſual life, <hi>chap.</hi> 2.24. <hi>There is no better thing than that a man ſhould eat and drink and that he ſhould make his ſoul enjoy good of his labour,</hi> and to the ſame purpoſe
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:95740:138"/> in ch. 3.13. and ch. 5.18, 19. But they ſhould conſider that <hi>Solomon</hi> only ſpeaks of the good of man with reſpect to this life, and the end that God giveth man the good things of this life for, vvhich is to uſe them for the outward comfort of his life, vvhich he ſpeaks of in oppoſition to ſuch to vvhom God hath given vvealth and riches and honour, yet <hi>hath not given him power to eat thereof,</hi> Eccl. 6.2. Sure there is a <hi>Medium</hi> betwixt <hi>ſordid ſparing,</hi> and <hi>luxurious ſpending,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt uſing meats and drinks to the due comfort of nature, and the abuſing them to the great injury of the ſoul. And though <hi>due feaſting</hi> is lawful, yet ſtill with reſpect to the proper ſeaſon, and not to be <hi>killing ſheep, and ſlaying oxen, and drinking wine in bowles</hi> vvhen God calls to faſting, and baldneſs, and gird<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of ſackcloth, as the Prophet complains, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 21.12, 13. and who can reckon the manifold evils that ariſe from this ſenſual courſe of life.

And as men are hereby injurious to themſelves, not only as Chriſtians, but as men, ſo they walk contrary to God in the preſent courſe of his Providence among us.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. We may hence take notice that God ſometimes calls us to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary duties, as this of <hi>Faſting</hi> is, and in ſuch caſes we are not to ſatisfie our ſelves with <hi>Ordinary.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Chriſtians ſhould, like thoſe men of <hi>Iſſachar, be wiſe in diſcerning the times,</hi> and the proper duties that belong to them. Chriſt would not have his Diſciples faſt while he vvas vvith them, but vvhen he vvas departed the duty would come in ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>So that if vve meet vvith matter of <hi>ſorrow</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi> let us not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged or offended, it will be ſo untill the <hi>Bridegroom</hi>'s return.</p>
            <p>Now therefore let us take a view of the preſent face of the times, and conſider vvhether this Extraordinary Duty of Faſting be not now in ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</p>
            <p>If we conſider the ſeveral occaſions which call for this duty, are they not all found at this day amongſt us?</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Is the abounding of ſin an occaſion?</hi> Pray conſider whether <hi>wickedneſs</hi> is not grown up to a greater height and <hi>impudence</hi> than in former ages in this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? what ſhameful, and yet ſhameleſs <hi>whoredom</hi> and <hi>drunkenneſs</hi> are among us, and <hi>Oaths</hi> that our Fathers knew not.</p>
            <p>Hovv many of theſe fools have we amongſt us, vvhich <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>that make a mock of ſin, Prov.</hi> 14.9. and mock at Religion as <hi>Fanaticiſin,</hi> deny <hi>Providence,</hi> and diſpute againſt a <hi>Deity.</hi> That novv it becomes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary vvith reſpect to many, inſtead of leading them to the higher points of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, to convince their reaſons of the Being of God, and to awake the <hi>innate notices</hi> of a Deity in their hearts, vvhich are even extinguiſh't by a courſe of ſin.</p>
            <pb n="265" facs="tcp:95740:138"/>
            <p>What endeavours are uſed by many to debauch men into vvickedneſs, and then to glory in vvhat they have done? And the more to take off the ſcandal of ſin they ſeek to propagate it and make it common, and if it vvas poſſible to make piety ſcandalous and vvickedneſs noble and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
            <p>Now ought there not to be <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi> when religion is thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed, the great God diſhonoured, and his Laws made void; was not this practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by <hi>David,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, becauſe men keep not thy Law, Pſal.</hi> 119.136.</p>
            <p>What we cannot reform, let us mourn over, and mourn the rather, becauſe thoſe that can and ought to do it, ſo little concern themſelves in it.</p>
            <p>And hath not the Temptation of the times overtaken many that have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly made great profeſſion, and drawn them to many unworthy complian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for ſecular advantages, and vvho have thereby laid up matter to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for future repentance and ſorrow? and are become to others objects of ſorrow alſo. As the Apoſtle blames the <hi>Corinthians</hi> about the inceſtuous perſon, <hi>why have ye not rather mourned,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. and vvas it not to have been wiſhed that all that fear God in the Nation ſhould have been better uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by this time both in <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> that vve might no longer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fame and perſecute one another untill the Net be thrown over us all, and it be then too late to <hi>relieve</hi> our ſelves, though not to <hi>repent.</hi> When many are at vvork to let in Popery as a torrent upon us, vve ſhould ſure endeavour to ſtern the Tide both by <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>praying</hi> unto God, and unity amongſt our ſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Is the diſtreſs of the Church of God an occaſion for it?</hi> Look abroad, and look at home, and you may behold ſuch a ſad face upon it, that may reflect ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon all your hearts, where hath God a people, eſpecially in theſe <hi>European</hi> parts of the world, but there is a diſtreſs upon them? whether ye look into <hi>France, Germany, upper or lower Hungaria, Sileſia, Polonia,</hi> &amp;c. And doth not all this make <hi>faſting</hi> a duty in ſeaſon; when <hi>Nehemiah</hi> heard from certain that came from <hi>Judah,</hi> that the <hi>Remnant left of the Captivity were in great affliction and that the wall of Jeruſalem was broken down,</hi> &amp;c. he ſate down, mourned, faſted and prayed before the God of heaven, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 1.4. and this he did, though he himſelf was in a good Office in the <hi>Perſian Court.</hi> Was our Condition ever ſo good at home, yet we ſhould lay to heart the afflictions of our brethren a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad. For as we are to <hi>rejoice with them that rejoice,</hi> ſo to <hi>weep with them that weep,</hi> and what further calamities may yet break forth we know not, but the sky looks ſtill red and lowring, and pourtends bad weather, and it is our wiſdom ſo to diſcern the face of the sky, as to betake our ſelves to the proper duty of the times.</p>
            <p>And thus to obſerve and ſerve the times is good Chriſtian policy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Is the agitation of great affairs in the world an occaſion for faſting?</hi> this alſo requires it of us at this day.</p>
            <p>Are not the Nations embroil'd in Wars both by Land and Sea? are there not alſo ſome negotiations of peace on foot? Is not the great Council of the Land to meet here at home? and do not theſe extraordinary affairs
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:95740:139"/> call us to extraordinary duties, that they may be all ſuperintended and guided to an happy iſſue in the end.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is there not a ſtrange ſtupidity and ſecurity upon the hearts of moſt men? that they vvill not ſee the hand of God, though they feel it, and though God walks contrary to them, yet they obſerve it not, but rather walk contrary to him in a courſe of ſin, than meet him by repentance in the way of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now the leſs others are affected, the more ſhould we endeavour to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect our own hearts; and to faſt the more becauſe they faſt not at all, and the more others are widening the breach, to ſtand ſo much the more in the gap, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 22.20.</p>
            <p>Now if we have theſe calls from God to this great duty of <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,</hi> let us not fail God herein, and though we ſhould obtain nothing for others, yet we may deliver our own ſouls; and we know the reſpect God had to thoſe that ſighed and mourned in <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that the Prophet was bid to ſet a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar mark upon them, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 9.4.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 20.</note>And I ſhall only add this further word of encouragement, <hi>i. e.</hi> That this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary duty of <hi>Faſting</hi> hath been often anſwered with extraordinary ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as <hi>Eſthers</hi> faſt when ſhe went in to the King, and <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi>'s Faſt, when the <hi>Ammonites, Moabites</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> invaded him, and <hi>Ezra</hi>'s faſt, <hi>ch.</hi> 8.23. and upon <hi>Daniel</hi>'s faſting he had the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> diſpatched to him to give him underſtanding in the things he ſought, <hi>ch.</hi> 9.22. and again upon his faſting in <hi>ch.</hi> 10. he ſaw a viſion, wherein a man appear'd to him, and told him that he was a man greatly beloved, and from the firſt day that he ſet himſelf to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand and chaſten himſelf before God, his prayers were heard, and ſometimes where ordinary prayer hath not prevailed, extraordinary hath had ſucceſs, which Chriſt intimates in ſaying, <hi>This kind cannot be caſt out but by faſting and prayer,</hi> Mat. 17.21.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that now faſt and mourn in the <hi>Bridegrooms</hi> abſence ſhall rejoyce with him for ever at his return, then they ſhall feaſt, but faſt no more, and the days of their mourning ſhall be ended, as Chriſt ſaid to his Diſciples, I will ſee you again, and your heart ſhall rejoice, <hi>and your joy no man taketh from you, John</hi> 16.21.</p>
            <p>Though their preſent <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>mourning</hi> hath a good in it beyond the worlds feaſting and rejoycing, yet the conſequent of it makes it incomparably better. The <hi>Bridegroom</hi> was once upon earth with his Church, but departed and ſo gave her occaſion of <hi>faſting</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi> but when he comes again, he and his Church ſhall never faſt, and therefore <hi>faſting</hi> will then never come into ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon again, as the faſt of the 4th 5th 7th 10th month was to the <hi>houſe of Judah joy and gladneſs, Zach.</hi> 8. ſo all the faſts kept by the people of God here on earth will be (and that incomparably) more joy and gladneſs to them in heaven, and that for ever.</p>
            <p>But to conclude all, take theſe two Rules.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Faſting</hi> being an extraordinary duty, ought to be managed with an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary exerciſe of grace, Chriſt would have his Diſciples endued with a greater meaſure of grace, before he would put them upon this duty; This new wine muſt be put into new bottles, ſo that as Chriſt asked <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John</hi> concerned his Baptiſm, are ye able to be baptized with my baptiſm?
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:95740:139"/> ſo may we ask Chriſtians now concerning <hi>faſting,</hi> are ye able to keep a <hi>faſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Faſting</hi> ought to be followed with ſincere and <hi>univerſal reformation,</hi> elſo it avails nothing. The <hi>Jews</hi> faſting mention'd <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58. vvas rejected upon this account. They vvent from their <hi>faſts</hi> to <hi>Strife, Debate, Oppreſſion, Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs,</hi> and no wonder then that they complain and ſay, <hi>why have we faſted, and thou takeſt no notice.</hi> Nay this reformation is ſo neceſſary, that the deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of a <hi>faſt</hi> is attributed to it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 58.6, 7. <hi>Is not this the Faſt that I have choſen, to looſe the bands of wickedneſs, to deal thy bread to the hungry,</hi> &amp;c. If moral duties be neglected, the practice of the ſtricteſt Inſtitutions is unaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God.</p>

            <p n="3">3. Here's a demonſtration of ſincerity, from the right performance of this duty, ſet forth by the <hi>Antitheſis:</hi> But <hi>thou</hi> ſhalt not be as the hypocrites, <hi>verſe</hi> 5.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>When] i. e.</hi> as often as thou prayeſt by thy ſelf, enter not thy houſe only, thy hall or thy common chamber, but thy cloſet, the moſt ſecret and retired priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. <hi>Shut the door]</hi> that others may neither diſcern thee, nor ruſh in ſuddenly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee. <hi>He ſhall reward thee] i. e.</hi> he ſhall anſwer thee and perform thy requeſt as a gracious return to thy ſecret ſincerity. God is pleaſed by promiſe to make himſelf a debtor to ſecret prayer. It brings nothing to God but empty hands and naked hearts: to ſhew that reward in Scripture ſence does not ſlow in up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſtreams of merit but grace. It's monkiſh divinity to aſſert otherwiſe, for what merit ſtrictly taken can there be in prayer: the meer asking of mercy cannot merit it at the hands of God, who out of our moſt ſincere petitions (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at beſt impregnated with ſinful mixtures) might take up matter enough to ſling as the dung of our ſacrifices in our faces.<note place="margin">Mal. 2.3.</note> We halt like <hi>Jacob</hi> both in and after our choiceſt and ſtrongeſt wreſtlings. But ſuch is the grace of our heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Father, who ſpies that little ſincerity of our hearts in ſecret, that he is pleaſed to accept us in his beloved, and to ſmell a favour of reſt in the fragrant per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes and odours of his interceſſion.</p>
            <p>Hence though I might draw forth ſeveral notes, yet ſhall treat but of one, containing the marrow and nerves of the Text.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Becauſe a ſincere heart buſies it ſelf about heart-work, to mortifie ſin, to quicken grace, to obſerve and reſiſt temptations, to ſecure and advance his evidences; and therefore is ſo much converſant in ſecret prayer. The glory of the King's daughter ſhines within,<note place="margin">Pſal. 45.13.</note> arrayed with clothes of gold: but they are the ſpangled and glittering hangings of the cloſet of her heart, when ſhe entertains communion with her Lord.

            <p n="2">2.

               <hi>How to manage ſecret prayer, that it may be prevalent with God to the comfort and ſatisfaction of the ſoul?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For methods ſake I ſhall divide it into two branches.</p>
            <p n="1">1. How to manage ſecret prayer that it may prevail with God?</p>
            <p n="2">2. How to diſcern and diſcover anſwers to ſecret prayer, that the ſoul may acquieſce and be ſatisfied that it hath prevailed with God?</p>
            <p>Before I handle theſe, I would briefly prove the duty and its uſefulneſs, leaving ſome caſes about its attendants and circumſtances towards the cloſe.</p>
            <p>As to the duty it ſelf, the text is plain and diſtinct in the point: yet further obſerve in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s prayer, that if any man beſides the community of the people of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhall preſent his ſupplication to God,<note place="margin">1 Kings 8 38, v. 39. 2 Chron. 6.29, 30. 2 Chron. 7.1.</note> he there prays for a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and particular anſwer, and we know <hi>Solomon</hi>'s prayer was anſwered by fire, and therefore hence we may learn a promiſe given forth to perſonal prayer. Beſides the many ſpecial and particular injunctions unto individual perſons in the caſe, as <hi>Job.</hi> 22.27. and 33.26. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.6. and 50.15. &amp;c. wives as well as husbands are to pray apart, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.14. <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> ſolitary, alone by themſelves, and <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.13.</p>
            <p>We may argue this point from the conſtant practice of the holy Saints of God in all ages, but eſpecially of our bleſſed Lord, and 'tis our wiſdom to walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous,<note place="margin">Prov. 2.20.</note> what ſhould I ſpeak of <hi>Abraham, Eliezar, Iſaac, Jacob, Moſes, Hannah, Hezekiah, David</hi> and <hi>Daniel.</hi> The time would fail me to bring in the cloud of Witneſſes, our Lord we find ſometimes in a Deſert, in a Mountain, in a Garden at prayer, <hi>Cornelius</hi> in his houſe, and <hi>Peter</hi> upon the houſe top in ſecret ſupplications to God.</p>
            <p>The experience of God's gracious preſence and anſwers ſent in upon ſecret prayer, as in the ſtories of <hi>Eliezer, Jabez, Nehemiah, Zechariah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Chron. 4.10. Nehem. 2.4. Pſal. 32.6.</note> 
               <hi>Cornelius</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> &amp;c. For this cauſe, becauſe <hi>David</hi> was heard, ſhall every one that is godly pray unto him.</p>
            <p>I might urge the uſefulneſs, nay in ſome caſes the neceſſities of ſecret appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Are we not guilty of ſecret ſins in the light of God's countenance, that cannot, ought not to be confeſſed with or before others, inſomuch that near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations are exhorted to ſecret and ſolitary duties, <hi>Zechariah</hi> 12.12. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.4.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Are there not perſonal wants that we would prefer to God alone.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Are there not ſome ſpecial mercies and deliverances that concern our own perſons more peculiarly, which ſhould engage to commune with our own hearts and offer the ſacrifices of righteouſneſs to God.<note place="margin">Pſal. 4.45.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. May there not be found ſome requeſts to be poured out more particularly in ſecret as to other perſons and as to affairs of the Church of God, which may not commodiouſly be inſiſted upon in common.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="272" facs="tcp:95740:143"/>5. Do not ſometimes emergent and urgent paſſions ſpring out of the ſoul in ſecret, that are not comely in ſociety.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To argue from the text, may not the ſouls ſecret addreſſes about inward ſorrows and joys,<note place="margin">Prov. 14.10. 2 Sam. 18.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>To end this, when a holy ſoul is cloſe in ſecret, what complacency does it take when it has bolted out the world, and retired to a place that none knows of, to be free from the diſturbances and diſtractions that often violate family communion: when 'tis in the ſecret of the face of God, in the hidden place of the moſt high,<note place="margin">Pſal. 31.20.91.1. Job 29.4.</note> and in the ſhadow of the Almighty, oh how ſafe, how comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table.</p>
            <p>Theſe and the like I paſs by, neither can I inſiſt upon ſecret prayer under the variety of mental and vocal; nor enlarge upon it as ſudden, occaſional or ejaculatory, referring ſomewhat of this toward the end.</p>
            <p>Let's addreſs then to the firſt queſtion, in anſwer whereto I muſt preface that ſome things which aptly belong to ſecret prayer, yet being in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure coincident with all prayer, publick, private, and ſecret, it's congruous to treat of ſuch as are of great uſe as to the management of our preſent duty, and therefore muſt refer to a double head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Queſt. <hi>How to manage ſecret prayer, as 'tis coincident with prayer in general, ſo that it may prevail?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Uſe ſome preparation before it, ruſh not ſuddenly into the awful pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God. Sanctuary preparation is neceſſary to ſanctuary communion. Such ſuitable preparatory frames of the heart come down from God. Thou wilt prepare the heart and cauſe thine ear to hear.

The work of preparation may be caſt under five heads, when we apply to ſolemn and ſet prayer.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The conſideration of ſome attributes in God that are proper to the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded petitions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A digeſtion of ſome peculiar and ſpecial promiſes that concern the affair.</p>

For how can we expect to be heard of God when we do not hear our ſelves, when the heart does not watch while the tongue utters. The tongue muſt be like the pen of a <hi>ready writer,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. Humble confeſſion of ſuch ſins as concern and refer principally to the work in hand. Our filthy garments muſt be taken away, when we appear before the Lord that hath choſen <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> Look upon my afflictions,<note place="margin">Zech. 3.4. Pſal. 25.18. Pſal. 39.8.12. Pſal. 103.3.</note> cries <hi>David,</hi> and forgive all my ſins. There are certain ſins that often relate to afflictions. Firſt, deliver me from my tranſgreſſions, then hear my prayer O Lord: for this is the heavenly method, he firſt forgiveth all our iniquities and then healeth all our diſeaſes. A forgiven ſoul is a healed ſoul, while a man is ſick at heart with the qualms of ſin unpardoned, it keeps the ſoul un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>deliquiums</hi> and ſwooning fits, that it cannot cry ſtrongly unto God, and therefore in holy groans muſt diſcharge himſelf of particular ſins, and pour out his ſoul before God. Thus did <hi>David</hi> in that great penitential Pſalm.<note place="margin">Pſal. 51.4. Iſa. 59.2. Ezra 9.6.</note> For ſin like a thick cloud hides the face of God that our prayers cannot en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We muſt bluſh with <hi>Ezra,</hi> and our faces look red with the fluſhings of conſcience, if we expect any ſmiles of mercy. Our crimſon ſins muſt dye our confeſſions; and the blood of our ſacrifices muſt ſprinkle the horns of the <hi>golden altar,</hi> before we receive an anſwer of peace from the <hi>golden mercy ſeat.</hi> When our perſons are pardoned, our ſuits are accepted, and our petitions crowned with the Olive-branch of peace.</p>

            <p n="5">5. Inward incouragements ſometimes ſpring in upon the heart in prayer from remembrance of former experiments, which mightily animate the ſoul with fervency.

            <p n="6">6. A ready heart for thankfulneſs and ſervice, the heart is brim full and ready to flow over in grateful memorials of his mercy. <hi>What ſhall I render to the Lord for all his benefits towards me.</hi>

The Law of Charity firmly binds you to it: If your children were fallen into a pit, would not nature tell you you are to help them out? If any of your houſe were falling into the fire, would not nature tell you you ſhould prevent it if you can? or ſnatch them out with haſte and ſpeed? Doth nature tell you (as hath been ſhewed) that there is a place of torment where ſinful Souls muſt ſuffer, and do you ſee any in your houſes in danger of falling into it, and will you ſit ſtill and do nothing to endeavour to prevent their everlaſting miſery? If they were ſick, or had drunk down poyſon, doth not nature tell you you ſhould uſe means for their recovery, to prevent their death? And doth not na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture tell you that their Souls are more precious than their Bodies, and more to be regarded? It doth: Certainly it doth. Are not their Souls ſick and diſeaſed, and poiſoned with the venom of ſin, and doth not nature tell you there is charity to be ſhewn to their Souls, as well as to their Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and much more? Certainly theſe are the dictates of nature; if I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe you have not one ſpark of grace, the light of reaſon will tell you all this.</p>

                     </note> to <hi>Family praying;</hi> is evident (we need to beg of God the <hi>illumination of his Spirit,</hi> the <hi>opening of the eyes</hi> of every one in the Family, the <hi>bleſſing of God</hi> upon our endeavours, without which it will be to no ſaving benefit) and vvill be more manifeſt, if vve conſider and lay together theſe things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Whoſe Word it is that is to be read in the Family together: the Word of the eternal, bleſſed, glorious God. And doth this call for and require preceding Prayer no more than if you were to read the Book of ſome mortal man? The Word of God is that <hi>out of which</hi> God ſpeaketh to us, it is that by which he doth inſtruct us and inform us in the higheſt and weightieſt concernments of our Souls, it is that <hi>from which</hi> we muſt fetch remedies for the cure of our ſpiritual maladies, it is that <hi>from whence</hi> we muſt have weapons of defence againſt our ſpiritual enemies that do aſſault our Souls, and be directed in the paths of life: and is not Prayer together needful then, that God would prepare all their hearts to receive and obey what ſhall be read to them of the mind of God? Is all the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily ſo ſerious and ſo ſenſible of the Glory, Holineſs, and Majeſty of that God that ſpeaketh to them in his Word, that Prayer is not needful that they may be ſo? And if it be needful, ſhould it not firſt be done? And when it hath been read, and the <hi>threatnings, commands,</hi> and <hi>promiſes</hi> of the <hi>glorious God</hi> been heard, and your <hi>ſins</hi> diſcovered, and God's <hi>wrath</hi> againſt them, and <hi>duties</hi> enjoined, and precious <hi>priviledges</hi> opened, and <hi>promiſes</hi> of a faithful God, both great and precious promiſes made to ſuch as do repent, believe and turn to God with all their hearts unfeignedly; have you not all need together to fall down upon your knees, to beg and cry and call to God for pardon of thoſe ſins that by this Word you are convinced you are guilty of, and to lament them before the Lord, and that, when your duty is diſcovered, you might have all hearts to practiſe and obey, and that you might unfeignedly repent and turn to God, that ſo you may apply thoſe <hi>promiſes</hi> to your ſelves, and be partaker of thoſe <hi>priviled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges?</hi> From this then there is great reaſon, when you read together, you ſhould alſo pray together.<note place="margin">Scripturis ſacris incumbat Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus fidelis, ibi in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniet condigna fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dei ſpectacula — ſpectabit mundum in delictis ſuis, Pio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum praemia, Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum ſupplicia, religione ſuperatas feras &amp; in manſue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinem c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Conſider what great and deep myſterious things are contained in the Word of God which you are to read together,</hi> and there vvill appear a neceſſity of praying together alſo. Is there not in this Word the Doctrine concerning God, how he might be known, loved, obeyed, worſhipped and delighted in? concerning Chriſt, God-man, a my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery that the Angels wonder at, and no man fully underſtands, or can expreſs and fully unfold? concerning the Offices of Chriſt, Prophet, Prieſt and King? the example and the life of Chriſt, the miracles of Chriſt, the temptations of Chriſt, the ſufferings of Chriſt, his death,
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:95740:165"/> the victories of Chriſt, the Reſurrection, Aſcenſion, and Interceſſion of Chriſt, and his coming to Judgment? Is there not in the Scripture the Doctrine of the Trinity, of the miſery of man by ſin, and his remedy by Chriſt? of the Covenant of Grace, the Conditions of this Covenant, and the Seals thereof? the many precious, glorious priviledges that we have by Chriſt, reconciliation with God, juſtification, ſanctification and adoption; the ſeveral graces to be got, and duties to be done, and of mens everlaſting ſtate in Heaven or Hell? are theſe and ſuch like contained in the Word of God that you ought to read daily in your houſes, and yet do not you ſee the need of Prayer before and after your reading of it? Weigh them well, and you will.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <hi>Conſider how much all the Family are concerned to know and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand theſe things ſo neceſſary to Salvation.</hi> If they are ignorant of them, they are undone: If they know not God, how ſhall they love him? <hi>Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa poſſunt amari, incognita nequaquam:</hi> Things <hi>unſeen</hi> may be loved, but things <hi>unknown</hi> cannot. We might love an unſeen God, and an unſeen Chriſt, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. But not an unknown God. If they in your Family know not Chriſt, how ſhall they believe on him? and yet they muſt periſh and be damned if they do not. They muſt for ever loſe God, and Chriſt and Heaven and their Souls, if they do not repent, believe, and be converted, and yet when that Book is read,<note place="margin">Petit ſe doceri divinitus, ut doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam rectè intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gat— ex antitheſi verò monet, omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um hominum men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes eſſe coecas, nec intelligere doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam quamdiu non illuminantur à Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritu ſancto— monet igi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> by which they ſhould underſtand the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of true ſaving Grace, is not Prayer needful? eſpecially when many have the Bible and read it, yet do not underſtand the things that do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern their peace.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Conſider further, <hi>The blindneſs of their minds, and their inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity without the teachings of God's Spirit, to know and underſtand theſe things,</hi> and yet is not Prayer needful?</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Conſider yet further, <hi>The backwardneſs of their hearts to hearken to theſe weighty, neceſſary truths of God, and their unwillingneſs naturally to learn,</hi> ſhews Prayer to be neceſſary that God would make them able and willing to receive them.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Once more conſider, <hi>That Prayer is a ſpecial means to obtain knowledg from God, and a bleſſing upon the teachings and inſtructions of the Maſter of the Family. David</hi> prayed that God would open his eyes, that he may behold wondrous things out of God's Law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.18. There are <hi>wondrous</hi> things in the Word of God; that fallen man ſhould be recovered is a <hi>wondrous</hi> thing, that a holy God ſhould be reconciled to ſinful man, is a <hi>wondrous</hi> thing, that the Son of God ſhould take up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him the nature of man, and God be manifeſted in the fleſh, and a believer juſtified by the righteouſneſs of another, theſe are WON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DROUS things. But there is darkneſs upon our minds, and a vail over our eyes, and the Scripture a claſped, cloſed Book, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſavingly underſtand theſe great wonderful things, to have our love chiefly upon them, and our delight in them, except the Spirit of God take away the vail, and remove our ignorance, and enlighten our minds; and this vviſdom is to be ſought from God by fervent
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:95740:165"/> Prayer. You that are Maſters of Families, would you have your Children and Servants know theſe things, and be affected with them? Would you have impreſſions made upon their minds and hearts of the great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Souls? and therefore you do inſtruct them; but can <hi>you</hi> reach their hearts? Can <hi>you</hi> awaken their Conſciences? Can <hi>you</hi> not? and yet doth it not become you to pray to God with them, that he would do it? While you are a praying <hi>jointly with them,</hi> God may be ſecretly diſpoſing and powerfully preparing their hearts to receive his Word, and your in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from it. From all this I argue thus for Family Prayer.</p>

When you wake in the morning, and find your dwelling ſafe, not conſumed with fire, not broke through by thieves, is not this a Family mercy? When you wake and find none dead in their beds, that news is not brought you in the morning, there is one Child dead in one bed, and another in another, and there is not a lodging room in the houſe, but the laſt night one or other died in it; but on the contrary, you find all well in the morning, and refreſhed by the reſt and ſleep of the night; are not theſe, and many more ſuch mercies to the Family, that when you riſe, you ſhould call them <hi>altogether</hi> jointly to bleſs God for? If it had been otherwiſe, <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> dead, <hi>Children</hi> or <hi>Servants</hi> dead, would not the reſt ſay, It would have been a mercy to us all if God had ſpared <hi>him, her,</hi> or <hi>them?</hi> if your houſe had been conſumed by flames, and God had turned you all out of doors before morning, would you not have ſaid, It would have been a mercy if God had

Why Sirs, will you not acknowledg mercies to be mercies, till God hath taken them away from you? and if you do, ſhould you not give the praiſe daily unto God? Was it not God himſelf that watched over you, while you did ſleep, and could not, did not, watch your ſelves? When you <hi>all did ſleep, you knew not where you were,</hi> nor <hi>what dangers you were expoſed unto,</hi> nor how you might prevent them, but God then was good unto you; and ſhould you not <hi>conjunctly</hi> acknowledg this when you do wake and riſe and ſee that God hath kept you, and do enjoy the comfort and the benefit of his watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Providence over you? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 127.1.— <hi>Except the Lord keep, the City, the Watchman waketh but in vain.</hi> 2.—<hi>for ſo he giveth his beloved ſleep.</hi>

                           <hi>Once we had praying time and hearing time, but we did not improve it for our good, elſe we had not been now in this extremity of pain; no we had not, no we had not. We did pray, but we did but triflle in our prayers, and did but dally with that God, whom now we find and feel to be to us conſuming fire, and yet we burn and are not conſumed: we were not in good earneſt in thoſe prayers we were at, but now we ſuffer in good earneſt, and are damned in good earneſt. Oh! this place is hot, it is hot, it is exceeding hot. Will not God pity us? will not God have mercy on us? we once thought he would, but we did flatter and deceive our ſelves, and thought it would be well becauſe we lived in a praying Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and were frequent at the duty; but we did not pray as they ſhould do, that were to pray for the eſcaping of ſuch dreadful torments; we did ſleep often in our prayers, but there is no ſleeping here no eaſe, no reſting here. O that God would try us once more, once more, were it but for a moneth or two, and ſet us out, and ſend us to a praying life again. O that we were in time again, in time again, and in the ſame circumſtances again, as once we were, and had the ſame poſſibility, yea probability of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaping thoſe reſtleſs torments. But this cannot be, this muſt not be, this will not be; time is gone, is gone, and we muſt pray no more for ever. O time, how didſt thou ſlip away! How ſwift was thy motion! O that this eternity would haſten as faſt as time did haſten. When we had lived twenty years, our life was ſo much nearer expiration; but here we have been a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, and yet as far from an end as the firſt moment we came into this dreadful place and dark and doleful dungeon: This then addeth to our miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that here we are, and muſt be here for ever, here we are, woe be to us that here we are, and that without all hopes of recovery, and poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and deliverance. Had our pain been extreme, yet if it had not been eternal, it might, have been the better born; or if it were to be eternal, if it
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:95740:177"/> had not been extreme, it might have been more eaſily endured; but to</hi> FEEL <hi>it is</hi> EXTREME, <hi>and to</hi> THINK <hi>it is</hi> ETERNAL, <hi>makes our miſery unexpreſſible. What! O what! extreme and eternal too! extreme and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal too! Cannot we dye? cannot we dig into our own bowels, and take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our own beings? but muſt we live in pain and torment extreme and eternal too? O miſerable Caitiffs that we are! thoſe creatures that were Toads and Serpents feel none of this; as they are not happy, ſo they are not miſerable; but we are not happy: no, no, there is no happineſs here; miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is our portion.

                        <p>Then think, before all this can be done unto your body, your Soul hath taken its flight into eternity, where it is, without change and alteration for ever, to be with God or Devils. Work it on your

Try whether ſuch believing thoughts as theſe will not ſtir you up to manage all your praying together (as well as apart) in that manner, that you ſhall find great benefit thereby.</p>

               <p>The laſt thing only now remains (wherein I muſt be ſhort) <hi>What excuſes are often brought for the non-performance of Family Prayer;</hi> How anſwered.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Obj.</hi> All this while you do not give us any one expreſs Scripture in ſo many words: ſhew that, and we will do it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> This is objected, either by openly profane, or more ſober men. To the firſt I anſwer,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Wilt thou do nothing but what thou haſt an expreſs command for in ſo many ſyllables? Why then art thou ſo often drunk? and doſt thou ſo often ſwear and lye and take Gods Name in vain? Where is thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Nay, is not all this againſt expreſs command?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Why doſt thou not do that for which thou haſt expreſs commands? Wilt thou repent, be holy and believe in Chriſt, and forſake thy ſin, if I can ſhew expreſs commands from God for theſe? Then read <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.30, 31. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.38. and 17.30. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. Go thy way now, and do theſe things ſincerely, and I ſhall not doubt but thou wilt ſee reaſon from what hath been ſaid to ſet up Prayer in thy Family, nor queſtion but thou wilt do it. But if thou wilt not repent, and leave thy manifeſt and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent ſins, when thou art expreſly commanded to do ſo, why ſhould any man think thou wouldeſt do this, if this were ſhewed to thee? Yet know, there is enough ſaid to render thee inexcuſable, if thou wilt not do it.</p>

                  </note> That <hi>what is drawn from the word of God by juſt, neceſſary, and immediate conſequence, is the mind of God:</hi> The ſenſe of the Scripture is God's revealed Will. And you your ſelves allow ſome things to be a duty, that are not expreſly comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Word of God.

No doubt: But where is your expreſs command? or any expreſs example that ever they did? Look for it, and produce it: Will you ſay the word <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="352" facs="tcp:95740:183"/> Conſequence muſt be allowed in this caſe, and is abundantly ſufficient.

As the woman of <hi>Samaria</hi> call'd her Neighbours, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.28, 29. If thou hadſt got ſome earthly Jewel, thou might'ſt be loth that others ſhould ſhare with thee in the value of it; becauſe in <hi>earthly things partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation cauſeth a diminution:</hi> if a ſum of money be divided amongſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the more one hath, the leſs will fall to the others ſhare.

Methinks then, when thou haſt been alone, and God hath graciouſly been with thee, thou ſhouldeſt go down into thy Family with burning love to God and them, and ſay, <hi>Come my Wife, Children, Servants, leave your work and buſineſs for a while; There is much ſweetneſs in communion with God: There is indeed delight which comes into the Soul by holy fervent Prayer; I would not have you feed on husks, while there is not only bread, but dainties too, in ſeeking God:</hi> I <hi>do not love to ſee you always mudling in the world, and be ſtrangers unto God. Come then, come away, for my Soul doth long that you ſhould taſt what I have found.</hi> Thus thou wouldeſt think ſurely with thy ſelf, if thou ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keſt not out to them, if thou didſt meet with God in ſecret. When it is not ſo with thee, but thou can'ſt conſtantly neglect Prayer in thy Family, reflect upon thy ſelf, whether in this ſenſe thou didſt not pray alone, that thou didſt not find God with thee warming of thy heart. Tell me, could'ſt thou be content to eat thy food conſtantly alone, without thy Wife and Children? and can'ſt thou be content to pray alone only? As you eat together, ſo pray together alſo.</p>

               <p>Anſw. 1. <hi>Where do you live?</hi> in <hi>London?</hi> What! an old houſekeeper in <hi>London,</hi> or where there hath been much means of Grace, and are you ſo ignorant, that you are not qualified to pray in your Family? This is your ſin; and will one ſin be pleadable to excuſe you from another? One of the Ancients of the Pariſh, and plead ignorance! are you not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham'd?</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>It is not parts and gifts and florid expreſſions that God looks at, but an humble, penitent, broken, and believing heart.</hi> Have you not this neither? If you have not, get it quickly, or you muſt to Hell: If you have, God will accept of ſuch a Sacrifice; bring it then.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Study your ſins and wants, and mercies;</hi> and get a ſenſe of all theſe

If a man feel himſelf ſick or hungry, do you think he could not find words to make his complaint, and ask for help? Study the Scripture and your own hearts, and theſe will be good prayer-Books to furniſh you for the duty: Beſides by praying you ſhall learn to pray.</p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Do not deceive your ſelf, and ſay, it is for want of gifts; when it is more for want of a heart and love to the duty.</hi> To diſcover this, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Law were made by our Governours, that every Maſter of a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily that doth not pray in his houſe with his Family, ſhall be caſt into the Lions Den: What would you do then? Would you rather venture your life and be torn in pieces by Lions, than ſet upon this duty, with that Knowledg, and thoſe Gifts that now you have? Would you not find ſomething to ſay to ſave your Lives? And is not the Law of God as binding as the Laws of men? and the Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon of Hell as dreadful as the Lions Den? Go then, ſet upon your duty.</p>

Even to the ſhutting of all graceleſs or at leaſt viſibly wicked perſons from all prayers in publick Congregations, as well as from Family duty; But this is ſo groſs, that I ſuppoſe you will not own it. You have no reaſon then for the other.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>How do you know, when you are confeſſing ſin and acknowledging the evil of it, but God might affect and break their hearts, and they be changed on their knees, and ſo be ſaved from damnation?</hi> and will you deny them that means that God may bleſs for their converſion?</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Do you indeed uſe all other means to your utmoſt power to have them better?</hi> Do you reprove them, and ſhew them the danger they are in? and perſwade them to turn from ſin to God, and this with conſtancy and compaſſion to their Souls? Or do you ſcruple this too? Wilt thou nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther pray with them, nor ſpeak to them, when thou oughteſt to do both? I doubt, it is thy ſloth, that hinders thee, or the wickedneſs of thy heart, and that thou pleadeſt the wickedneſs of another to cover thine own.</p>

               <p n="7">7. <hi>But be really more careful that you do not pray to God with a reigning luſt in your own hearts, than fearful to pray with an unconverted perſon in your houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Obj. 6. <hi>But I cannot bring my Servants to the duty; they are ſo ſtubborn and unwilling to it, that all that I can do, cannot prevail with them to yield thereto; they will rather leave my houſe; and ſo I ſhall be left to do my work my ſelf.</hi>

Can you uſe your power <hi>effectually</hi> to make them do your work, though backward to it; and <hi>may</hi> you not, <hi>can</hi> you not, to bring them to prayer, if you were as hearty and as in good earneſt, for the glory of God and the good of their ſouls, as you are in your own concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>

It was a ridiculous action of a rich man, that Mr. <hi>Rogers</hi> in his <hi>Treatiſe of Love</hi> ſpeaks of, that being very ſick to death called for his Gold, and being brought to him took a twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſhillings piece and put it in his mouth, ſaying, <hi>Some are wiſer than ſome; this I will take with me however:</hi> If ſome were not wiſer than <hi>he,</hi> they would all be fools; for he and his gold might periſh together: though it may be likely that when he was dead, his gold was taken from him, and ſo in his own ſenſe he was not wiſer than others. <hi>But will gold go in Heaven or in Hell?</hi> There it is nothing worth. When you have got much by your trading, which keeps you from praying, will it not make you loth to dye, having laid up no better treaſure elſewhere? and vex you to the heart, that for this you have loſt God and Chriſt and Heaven and your ſouls, and your riches too at laſt? As Mr. <hi>Latimer,</hi> in a Sermon before King <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:95740:185"/> the Sixth,</hi> relates of a rich man that was ſick, and one coming to him and ſeeing how he was, told him, he thought he could not recover, but was a dead man; who preſently flew into a rage, ſaying, <hi>Muſt I die? Send for the Phyſician, wounds! ſides! heart! Muſt I die? muſt I die? wounds! ſides! heart! Muſt I die, and leave all my riches?</hi> and ſo continued crying out in this language, till he dyed: and are theſe the things you are ſo earneſt for, that you can find no time to pray for better? A like paſſage Mr. <hi>Jeremy Burroughs</hi> on <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.14. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates of one that once lived near to him, that being ſick call'd for his bags of ſilver, and hugging them in his arms ſaid, <hi>Muſt I leave you? muſt I leave you?</hi> Pray for an intereſt in God and Chriſt, and when you die, being his and he yours, you ſhall not leave him, but be taken into fuller enjoyment of him. Conſider again, as you cannot take them with you when you die, ſo theſe things cannot comfort you in your Sickneſs. As the ſame Author mentions another, that on his ſick bed call'd for his bags of gold, which being brought he laid to his breſt as near his heart as he could, but after a while ſaid, <hi>Here, take them again, take them again; theſe will not do, theſe will not do.</hi> What will not bags of gold do? No: they are traſh and dirt to a dying man. What will they not do? They will not procure health to a ſick man, nor prolong life to a dying man, nor ſpeak peace to a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled man, nor procure Heaven for a graceleſs man: No, no, <hi>it will not do, it will not do;</hi> and you ſhall find <hi>it will not do.</hi> And are theſe the things you are ſo bent upon, that you have no time for looking after theſe to pray to God for ſomething that would do you good, while you live, when you die, and after death?

I fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low now the <hi>Order</hi> of my <hi>Text,</hi> to declare in the <hi>Second place</hi> the ſpecial <hi>Duty of the Husband</hi> in this Poſition, namely,</p>
               <p> 
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> 
                  <hi>The great Duty of every Husband is to Love his own Wife.</hi> This is the <hi>foundation</hi> of all the reſt, this muſt be <hi>mixed</hi> with all the reſt, this is the <hi>Epitome</hi> of all the reſt of his <hi>Duty.</hi> And hence this is expreſly mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned <hi>four times</hi> in this <hi>Chapter,</hi> verſ. 25, 28, 33. as being the <hi>great wheel,</hi> which by its motion carries about all the other wheels of the <hi>affections</hi> that are within us, and the <hi>actions</hi> that are without us. Fix but this bleſſed <hi>Habit</hi> in the heart, and it will teach a man, yea it will <hi>enforce</hi> a man, to all that tenderneſs, honour, care and kindneſs that is required of him. <hi>Theſe</hi> are but the <hi>beams</hi> from that <hi>Sun,</hi> they are but the <hi>fruits</hi> from that <hi>root</hi> of real Love that is within. <hi>Love ſuffereth long and is kind, it envies not, is not puffed up, ſeeks not her own, is not eaſily provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, thinketh none evil, beareth all things,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.4, 6.</p>
               <p>It is here as it is in <hi>Love to God,</hi> which (you know) doth both <hi>inſtruct</hi> and <hi>thruſt</hi> a man on to the utmoſt of his Duty, excluding thoſe <hi>wary fears,</hi> wherewith hypocrites abound, leſt they ſhould do too much. Even ſo <hi>Love to a man's Wife ſuggeſts</hi> all fit expreſſions thereof, and <hi>carries</hi> a man to perform the higheſt effects of it, when as the want of this cauſes him to <hi>diſpute</hi> every inch of God's command, and to be <hi>jealous</hi> of every preſcription.</p>
               <p>I ſhall trace this comprehenſive <hi>Grace or Duty,</hi>

               <pb n="380" facs="tcp:95740:197"/>
               <p>In purſuance of this I ſhall not expatiate, but keep near my <hi>Text. Two things</hi> proclaim the <hi>Reverence</hi> that the <hi>Church</hi> bears to <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>The Matter of her Subjection,</hi> and that is <hi>in every thing:</hi> ſhe doth not yield in great matters, and ſtick at ſmall, nor yield in ſmall things, and deny in great: ſhe doth not yield to him only ſo far as her <hi>Intereſt</hi> or <hi>Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite</hi> permits her; but when he requires it, denies them both. So ſaith the <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> verſ. 24. <hi>Let the wives be ſubject to their own husbands in [every thing]</hi> that is, in every thing that is not forbidden by an higher power, even the <hi>Law of God.</hi> Indeed, if a thing be only <hi>inconvenient,</hi> the wife may mildly reaſon and ſhew the <hi>inexpediency</hi> of it; but if ſhe cannot convince and ſatisfie her Husband, ſhe muſt (if there be <hi>no ſin</hi> in the caſe) ſubmit her <hi>reaſon</hi> and her <hi>will</hi> to his.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>The Manner of her ſubjection ſpeaks her Reverence;</hi> and that is <hi>free, willing, chearful.</hi> Thus the <hi>Church</hi> yields up her ſelf to the will of her husband; inſomuch as it is made a kind of <hi>proverbial</hi> pattern, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.7. <hi>with good will, doing ſervice as to the Lord;</hi> implying that the ſubjection and ſervice that we perform to the Lord is <hi>with a good will.</hi> And <hi>ſuch</hi> ought to be the ſubjection of the wife, moſt <hi>free</hi> and <hi>willing;</hi> ſo, as if there were but<note n="(a)" place="margin">Nam quae ita vivit, ut ſe ac ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritum rem prorſus unam eſſe arbitre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur, haec abſolvit numeros omnes ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctae uxoris. <hi>Lu.

               <p>And this hath brought us to the <hi>Third thing,</hi> by which the <hi>Reverence</hi> of the <hi>Wife</hi> is deſcribed, and that is by the <hi>Effects</hi> thereof; And they alſo are either, 1. <hi>In word,</hi> or 2. <hi>In deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>In word.</hi> For <hi>out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi> And if there be that inward <hi>fear</hi> and <hi>reſpect</hi> in the heart, which God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, it will be legible in the <hi>words</hi> of their mouths. The ſame Law that binds the heart in this caſe, doth alſo govern the tongue. <hi>In her tongue is the law of kindneſs,</hi> Prov. 31.26.

            <p>Firſt, <hi>That God did in infinite wiſdom make all things, though of a far different nature.</hi> Some beings he made more excellent, and indowed them with noble faculties, fitted for communion with himſelf: and ſome of theſe he hath placed in a higher and ſome in a lower orb; and yet all making the glory of infinite wiſdom ſhine more clearly. He <hi>ſets</hi> one creature <hi>higher,</hi> and another <hi>lower:</hi> one <hi>to rule,</hi> and the other <hi>to be ruled.</hi> And of the ſame kind he <hi>advanceth one</hi> above <hi>another,</hi> and yet with no <hi>injuſtice</hi> or <hi>wrong</hi> to any, <hi>but for the mutual help one of another, the beauty and harmony of the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe,</hi> and <hi>the more viſible diſplaying of his own unſearchable wiſdom.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>What are the Duties of Maſters and Servants, and how muſt both eye their great Maſter in Heaven?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the anſwering of this Queſtion the more fully, I ſhall do theſe things:</p>
            <p>Firſt, Show you <hi>what is meant by Maſter and Servant.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Show you <hi>how both are to eye their great Maſter in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, I ſhall ſhow you <hi>what is the Maſter's duty, exhort him to it, and give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> him helps for the performance of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fourthly, I ſhall ſhow <hi>what is the duty of Servants, preſs them to it, and give <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> them ſome helps for the performance of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall ſhow <hi>what is meant by Maſter and Servant.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Maſter</hi> here is meant either <hi>Maſter or Miſtreſs,</hi> ſuch a <hi>one</hi> as <hi>hath the power of himſelf, and upon whoſe government and command another depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now in an <hi>abſolute</hi> and <hi>moſt proper ſenſe</hi> there is <hi>none</hi> may be called <hi>Maſter</hi> but <hi>God;</hi> he only hath an abſolute, independent, unlimited power of himſelf, and hath all others at his command and direction, and he alone is fit for this deſpotick Monarchy, being infinite in wiſdom, goodneſs and juſtice. And this clears the meaning of thoſe words of our Saviour, <hi>Call no man Father, Maſter,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 23.8.</note> 
               <hi>but God,</hi> that is, look upon none as abſolute, infallible Lords of the Conſcience, but him.</p>
            <p>But in a <hi>more limited ſenſe</hi> there are <hi>Maſters,</hi> to <hi>which reſpect</hi> and <hi>honour</hi> muſt be <hi>paid</hi> by their <hi>Servants,</hi> and that with <hi>all readineſs</hi> and <hi>chearfulneſs, ſo far</hi> as they <hi>command nothing</hi> that is <hi>contrary</hi> to <hi>God's command.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By <hi>Servant,</hi> I mean <hi>one that is not at his own diſpoſal,</hi> but <hi>at the command of another,</hi> ſo <hi>far as his commands thwart not</hi> the <hi>commands of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Remember whatever is <hi>ſpoken</hi> of <hi>Servants,</hi> is <hi>ſpoken</hi> to <hi>Maid-Servants</hi> as well as <hi>Men-Servants,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this Relation ſeems in a word to riſe from <hi>Nature, Law,</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</hi> From <hi>Nature,</hi> in that <hi>ſome are</hi> of a more ſtrong body, and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er underſtanding; others of weaker bodies, but of <hi>more judgment</hi> and <hi>experience;</hi> and ſo one is by nature fit to rule, and the other to be ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>
            <p>That Relation that riſeth from <hi>Law,</hi> is when any <hi>one</hi> by ſome <hi>flagitious act</hi> hath juſtly <hi>forfeited</hi> his <hi>liberty,</hi> and is <hi>condemned</hi> to <hi>ſervility</hi> either for <hi>a time,</hi> or <hi>during his life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The laſt and uſual foundation of this Relation is by <hi>Contract,</hi> and that is, where <hi>one</hi> that is <hi>by nature free, ſubjects himſelf</hi> to <hi>another's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand</hi>
               <pb n="446" facs="tcp:95740:230"/> for a <hi>certain time, upon ſuch and ſuch juſt conſiderations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now this is that <hi>Relation</hi> that I am <hi>principally concerned</hi> to <hi>ſhew</hi> you <hi>the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of.</hi>

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, I come now to ſhew you, <hi>how</hi> both <hi>Maſter</hi> and <hi>Servants</hi> are to <hi>eye</hi> their <hi>great Maſter</hi> in <hi>Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, they are both to <hi>have an eye to the preſence of their great Maſter which is in Heaven.</hi> God in his Nature is a Spirit, that is infinitely immenſe, filling Heaven and Earth, and yet not included in either. If man did indeed lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the lively impreſſions of God's omniſciency and omnipreſence, what an awe would it put upon their ſpirits? how honeſt would it make them in the dark? <hi>This,</hi> this would <hi>make</hi> the <hi>Maſter reaſonable, juſt</hi> and <hi>merciful; this</hi> would <hi>make</hi> the <hi>Servant faithful, diligent and conſtant</hi> in his obedience to his Maſter.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, both <hi>Maſters and Servants muſt have an eye to the glory of their great Maſter in Heaven.</hi> There is not an action in our whole lives, but we ſhould ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>habitually</hi> or <hi>actually</hi> reſpect God's glory in it; and it is but <hi>reaſonable,</hi> that he <hi>of whom all things are, and by whom all things are preſerved,</hi> and from whom are all our hopes of good here and hereafter, ſhould <hi>have</hi> all <hi>Glory for ever and ever.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Actions</hi> looſe their <hi>excellency</hi> when they have not a right end: and to make any thing our end below God,<note place="margin">Hierocles.</note> is little leſs than idolatry. It was excellent advice given, more then once, by that brave <hi>Moraliſt, Refer all things to God, make him your center, your end.</hi> I ſhall conclude with another of that noble <hi>Emperour Marcus Aurelius Antoninus</hi> ſayings; <hi>Remember always in all things thy Relation to God, for without reſpect to him thou wilt never perform any action aright while thou liveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="447" facs="tcp:95740:230"/>
            <p>Thirdly, both <hi>Maſters and Servants muſt have an eye to the command of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> their great Maſter in Heaven.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 119.6.</note> Ask <hi>David</hi> how you ſhall <hi>eſcape</hi> a <hi>ſtate</hi> and <hi>act of ſhame,</hi> and he will tell you, <hi>by having reſpect unto all God's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If men would never command any thing but what they have warrant for from the Word of God, commands would then be juſt, and obedience eaſie: then the poor Servant would never be put upon that ſad Dilemma, whether he ſhould <hi>obey his earthly or heavenly Maſter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Acts 5.29.</note> The <hi>Pythagoreans</hi> were not at all out in that Doctrine of theirs; <hi>That man is under an Oath of Allegiance to God, to be obedient to his Laws, and never willingly to tranſgreſs them.</hi> If the Maſter conſult God's commands, then he will forbear threatning, and not make his Servants to ſerve with rigor, and be faithful, meek, putting on bowels and pity, warning, inſtucting and correcting, like a Chriſtian, in love to them, and obedience to God. If the Servant had ſtill an eye to their great Maſter's commands, how ſingly, uprightly, diligently and chearfully would they obey? <hi>To the Law, to the teſtimony; and peace will be to them that walk according to this Rule, and the whole Iſrael of God.</hi> Both Maſters and Servants,<note place="margin">Enchiridion.</note> yea <hi>all men</hi> in all things ſhould ſtill be of <hi>Epictetus his mind,</hi> and ſtill <hi>uſe</hi> his <hi>Petition; Lead me O God whither thou pleaſeſt, I will follow thee chearfully, and if I be ſomething unwilling, yet notwithſtanding I am reſolved to look to thy command, and obey it.</hi> Let God's Word be our Counſellor, and we can't do an unjuſt and imprudent act.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Both <hi>Maſters and Servants muſt have an eye to the aſſiſtance of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> their great Maſter in Heaven.</hi> Our heavenly Maſter is ſo humble and kind, that he never bids any Servant do any work, but he is willing to put his own hand to it; and to ſay the truth of it, the beſt Servant of all is ſo weak and fooliſh, that he is not able to manage the leaſt piece of work his Maſter ſets him about, except himſelf be at one end of it, and do the moſt of it, nay I had almoſt ſaid, do all of it himſelf. And if God ſtand by, direct and aſſiſt, how wiſely,<note place="margin">John 15.4.</note> gently and piouſly will Maſters do their part? and how patiently, diligently and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily will Servants do theirs? then the Maſters will not threaten, nor the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants groan or complain. But I may have occaſion to ſpeak ſomething of this nature elſewhere.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, Both <hi>Maſters and Servants muſt have an eye to the ſoveraignty, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> power and juſtice of their great Maſter.</hi> He is higher than the higheſt; he hath us in his hand, as the Clay is in the hand of the Potter, and none of his ways are unequal; he will do righteouſly, when men do not; and the day is coming, when Maſters and Servants, King and Subjects, muſt ſtand upon even ground before him, and he will do unto every one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works. O that Maſters would remember that God is infinitely more above them, than they are above the pooreſt Servant: Were this well weighed, how ſoon would the heat of ſome Maſters be cooled, their ſtorms be calmed, and their fury turned into meekneſs? Remember man, God can eaſily, without doing any injury at all, make thee and thy Servant change places. O that Servants could ſtill
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:95740:231"/> remember that they have a greater and a better Maſter that muſt be pleaſed, whoſoever is diſpleaſed: the deep ſenſe of God's ſoveraignty would quickly make the proudeſt heart ſtoop: this, this would pull down the ſtout, inſolent, rebellious ſpirit of a wicked Servant, and make him judge obedience far more tolerable then flames; and if any thing of injury be done him by his Maſter, the thoughts of God's juſtice and righting will quiet his mind.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I come now to the third thing propoſed, which vvas to ſhew you <hi>What is the Maſter's duty, and to exhort him to it.</hi> And this I ſhall do by giving him</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Some cautionary Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Poſitive Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, I ſhall give you ſome <hi>cautionary Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, Let <hi>Maſters take heed of being ſervants to ſin</hi> and <hi>Satan,</hi> and <hi>rebels to God.</hi> A <hi>bad man</hi> is not like to be a <hi>good Maſter.</hi> With what face can any man expect others ſhould obey him (whoſe commands are uſually unreaſonable) whilſt he diſobeyeth God, whoſe commands are always good and equal? How can a drunken, prayerleſs, ſwearing wretch, look for better ſervice than he gives to his Maſter?</p>
            <p>By ſin man at firſt forfeited that Soveraignty that he had over the creatures; and by a conſtant habit of ſin, eſpecially groſs ſins, which the light of Nature doth condemn, a man proſtitutes his reaſon, debaſeth his authority, and looſeth that majeſty which elſe he is inveſted with. How can a drunken Maſter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke or puniſh his ſervant for tipling? Is an intemperate Senſualiſt a fit perſon to cenſure gluttony? Can an unclean perſon condemn wantonneſs? Is it likely that the Servant ſhould be faithful, who ſeeth his Maſter cheat and lye every day? If the Maſter be a profuſe Gameſter, and given to his pleaſure, is it like that his Servant ſhould be frugal and diligent? Are not <hi>lying,</hi> and <hi>ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> and <hi>curſing,</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs</hi> as ſoon <hi>learned</hi> of a <hi>Maſter,</hi> as a <hi>Trade?</hi> And is it worth the while for a man to give twenty, fourty, a hundred pound to teach his child to ſerve the Devil, and a ſhort cut to hell, and a ſure way to ruin and miſery of body and ſoul? Is that man fit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern another that can't rule himſelf? Is he that hath drowned his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon capable of inſtructing one, that which requires ſome vviſdom to underſtand, and learn, and more to teach? Are not Sots, that can't ſpeak ſenſe, in a ſweet frame to ſpeak to God in Prayer, or to read a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? What have ſuch to do to take God's name into their mouths, which hate to be reformed? O that wicked Maſters would conſider that their wickedneſs doth not only hazzard the damnation of a ſingle ſoul, but even of all that are under their charge. Is it not enough to have your own ſins to be lay'd to your charge? are all your oaths and lyes and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs too little to ſink you, but you muſt make your Servants ſins yours? Is <hi>one</hi> damnation too little, but you muſt ſeek to <hi>double</hi> it? Are thoſe flames ſo cool and tolerable that you are buſie in adding fuel to that ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible fire to make it burn ſeven times hotter? What a hell muſt ſuch a mans houſe be, in which the Name of God is ſcarce heard, except it be in an oath or a curſe? Is there a bleſſing like to be in the houſe on which
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:95740:231"/> God's curſe reſts? Friends, I believe you would be loth your children ſhould have <hi>Cham</hi>'s curſe, and be ſervants to a Tyrant and a Slave;<note place="margin">Prov. 3.33. <hi>Pythagoras.</hi>
               </note> a wicked man is both. Maſters, if <hi>you</hi> would have <hi>your ſervants</hi> obey your <hi>commands,</hi> you muſt not <hi>break God's.</hi> If you would have them ſober, you muſt not be drunk; if you would have them chaſt, you muſt not be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy; if you would have them true, you muſt not be falſe; if you would have them good, you muſt not be bad your ſelves. Your <hi>example ſignifieth more</hi> to them than your <hi>precept:</hi> do not undo that by your actions and life, which you would build up by your words. O! little do wicked Maſters think what a plague they are to a City, what a curſe to a Family, and what inevitable ruin they expoſe their own and other ſouls, bodies and eſtates to, except infinite power and mercy ſtep in quickly to prevent it.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed of <hi>idleneſs, careleſſneſs, and truſting your Servants too <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> much.</hi> A maſter's <hi>negligence</hi> tempts the Servant to <hi>unfaithfulneſs.</hi> When <hi>Maſters</hi> are <hi>idle abroad,</hi> uſually the <hi>Servants</hi> are ſo at <hi>home.</hi> It can't well be expected, that when the Maſter is ſpending his time fooliſhly and unaccoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably in the Coffee-houſes, Ale-houſes, or Taverns, the Servant ſhould ſpend his wiſely in the Shop; eſpecially where he obſerves that the Maſter never minds which end goes foremoſt, never examines his Books, nor calls him to any ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count. O this ſin of idleneſs, that Sodomitical, ſoul-debaſing, body-weakning,<note place="margin">Ez. 16.49.</note> eſtate-waſting ſin! Have we a mind to try whether God will rain ſuch another ſtorm of brimſtone upon us, as once he did upon them?<note place="margin">Seneca.</note> O how many perſons are very prodigal of that commodity which will ſhortly be very preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</p>
            <p>Sirs, do you never take a Bible in your hands? do you never read how much God is diſpleaſed with ſloth, how oft he forbids it?<note place="margin">Rom. 12.11. Prov. 18.19.</note> Can you call your ſpending three or four hours together in an idle houſe in inſignificant chat, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming the time? Is neglecting your Servants the way to make them faithful? O think of theſe things before it is too late. I know men have their excuſes, and can eaſily evade what I ſay. But believe it, it is one thing to deal with a poor Miniſter, and another thing to deal with God: and a thouſand of your pleas, when they are caſt into his ballance at the Day of Judgment, will be found light. If <hi>men</hi> muſt be <hi>judged for idle words,</hi> I believe they will <hi>ſcarce</hi> be <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted</hi> for <hi>idle actions.</hi> I wiſh we that are Maſters could oft ſpeak to our ſelves in that brave <hi>Emperor's</hi> language,<note place="margin">Antoninus. l. <hi>5.</hi> n. <hi>1.</hi>
               </note> 
               <hi>In the morning when thou findeſt thy ſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to riſe, conſider with thy ſelf preſently, it is to go about a man's work, that I am ſtirred up: am I unwilling to do that for which I was born, and brought into this world? was I made for this, to lay me down, and make much of my ſelf in a warm bed?</hi> O but this is pleaſing. And was it for this that thou wert born, that thou mighteſt take thy pleaſure? Was it not in truth that thou ſhouldeſt alwayes be buſie and in action? Seeſt thou not, how every thing is buſie in its kind to perform what belongs to it in its place? &amp;c. and you uſe to ſay, <hi>If you keep the ſhop, the ſhop will keep you.</hi> If you keep not your eye upon your ſervant, when you hope to find an honeſt man, you may meet a thief.</p>

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Take heed <hi>who you admit into your Family.</hi> One that is born of wicked debauched Parents, and hath had nothing but bad examples, and ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom good precepts; that hath been accuſtomed to lying and baſeneſs from the Cradle, that hath not been taught to read, and knows neither his duty to God nor man, that is ignorant of God, Chriſt, Soul, Heaven, Hell, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently is not capable of lying under the force of the moſt powerful motives to faithfulneſs.<note place="margin">Pſal. 101 3.</note> 
               <hi>David</hi> was huge <hi>cautious</hi> in this point; <hi>a lyer ſhould not dwell in his houſe.</hi> As good ſervants bring a bleſſing along with them into the Families where they come;<note place="margin">Gen. 39 5.</note> ſo ſometimes wicked ſervants bring a curſe with them into the houſe where they come. Little do Maſters think how much dammage a neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect in this may bring upon them, their eſtate may inſenſibly be waſted, their other Servants infected, their Children be corrupted, and proviſions laid in to feed their ſorrows all their days. Never talk of what thou ſhalt have with them; how reſponſable their Parents be: will this ballance the hazard of your Childrens Souls? Sooner <hi>take</hi> a <hi>toad</hi> into your <hi>boſome,</hi> then a <hi>wicked ſervant</hi> into your <hi>Family.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, Take heed of <hi>putting your Servants upon too much work.</hi> It's the way to <hi>alienate their affections,</hi> to make them almoſt <hi>uncapable</hi> of doing their <hi>duty</hi> as they ſhould to <hi>God,</hi> it puts them upon cryes and groans to him,<note place="margin">Exod. 2.24:</note> that hath ever an ear open to the complaints of the oppeſſed: by this you make them more blockiſh, and leſs ingenuous, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not ſo fit to carry on your buſineſs ſo much for your intereſt, as elſe they might do: remember how contrary this is to humanity. How would you like this in others? Were the <hi>Egyptians</hi> to be <hi>juſtified for their great burdens</hi> wherewith they <hi>loaded</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> to be <hi>commended</hi> for the hard <hi>vaſſalage</hi> they <hi>put poor Chriſtians to?</hi> I know you readily cenſure both theſe, and how can you condemn either, when you imitate both? Is your ſin leſs becauſe againſt greater light? except you deſire the curſe of God and man too, take heed of this ſin. You may <hi>learn</hi> more <hi>mercy</hi> from an <hi>Heathen</hi> than you ever <hi>practiſed:</hi> For he tells you,<note place="margin">Seneca de Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentia.</note> 
               <hi>That your ſervants are the inferior, and poor friends, and are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted next to children, and came not into the houſe for ſervitude and vaſſalage, but patronage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, Take heed of <hi>letting them have too littie employment:</hi> It's of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence to get a habit of idleneſs. It was none of the leaſt <hi>commendations</hi> of that <hi>worthy woman,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 31.27.</note> that <hi>ſhe would ſuffer none in her houſe to eat the bread of idleneſs.</hi> As you muſt give an <hi>account</hi> of your own time; ſo muſt you alſo of <hi>your ſervants too,</hi> how it is ſpent. When your <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> are <hi>idle,</hi> the <hi>Devil</hi> is at <hi>work.</hi> If <hi>you</hi> have <hi>nothing</hi> for them <hi>to do,</hi> remember <hi>God</hi> hath <hi>ſomething.</hi> Set them to reading the Word, praying, and put them upon <hi>uſing all diligence in making their calling and election ſure.</hi> It is far better to have no Servant, than to keep one to do nothing but look about him. This, this hath laid the foundation of ſome young mens ruin this is unfaithfulneſs to God and man, by this you wrong body and ſoul.</p>
            <pb n="451" facs="tcp:95740:232"/>
            <p>Sixthly, Take heed of <hi>bitterneſs and threatning, of cruelty and injuſtice, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> of wronging them in meat, drink, clothing, or lodging; and neglecting them when they are ſick, and denying them that tendance, phyſick, and care that is fit for them at ſuch a time.</hi> Take heed of calling them names, and curſing them, and of correcting them with unreaſonable weapons, for ſlight or no faults; and <hi>uſing them worſe than a merciful man would do his beaſt.</hi> Are not your Servants of the ſame mettal with your ſelves? they have ſenſe and feeling as well as you; their fleſh is not iron, nor their bones braſs; Would you have God give you ſuch mercy as you give your Servants? If he ſhould mark what you do amiſs, what would ſoon become of you? Did you never <hi>read</hi> the <hi>woes</hi> that <hi>God denounceth againſt oppreſſors?</hi> and <hi>do you think God threatens in jeſt?</hi> can't he eaſily give life and execution to his woes? and where are you then man? What if God ſhould curſe when you curſe? what if he ſhould ſtrike as well as you? are you able to bear the ſtrokes that his hand can lay on? can thy heart endure, or thy back bear what he can inflict? when you are juſt lifting up your hand, conſider a little the nature of the fault, and do as thou would'ſt have God do by thee, and then be outragious and cruel if you can. Remember your Servants are God's Servants, and you muſt not rule them with rigour:<note place="margin">Lev. 25.42, 43 Deut. 24.14. Jam. 5.4.</note> read thoſe Scriptures which you find quoted in the Margent. Some may wonder that I inſiſt upon this caution ſo long; but I wiſh the empty bellies, the thin checks, the black and blew skins of many poor Servants did not give me too good reaſon for what I ſay.<note place="margin">Anton. l. <hi>5.</hi>

               </note> I ſhall deſire ſuch Maſters to ask themſelves ſometimes, Whoſe Soul do I now properly poſſeſs, a Tyrant's, a Mad-man's, or a Beaſt's? Suppoſe your Servant is not ſo wiſe, ſtrong, and active as you would have him, it may be for this, he more needs pity than blows or curſes. But if he be really faulty, were you never ſo too? and when <hi>puniſhment</hi> is <hi>due,</hi> remember that <hi>Religion, Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> muſt <hi>always meaſure puniſhment.</hi> Think not they are in your power, and poor, and friendleſs, and that they have none that can or will right them. If this were a good warrant for oppreſſing another, how many are there who would ſoon cruſh you to pieces?</p>
            <p>Seventhly, Take heed of <hi>neglecting your Servants ſouls.</hi> Their <hi>ſouls</hi> as <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> well as their <hi>bodies</hi> are <hi>your charge;</hi> and you <hi>muſt</hi> be <hi>accountable</hi> ſhortly for <hi>them.</hi> O! how few conſider ſeriouſly of this? Are not the ſouls of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants ſlighted, as if they were little better than the ſouls of Brutes? Sirs, is that which Chriſt thought <hi>worth his blood,</hi> not <hi>worth your care?</hi> The neglect of moſt Maſters in this thing is horrible. How ſeldom do they ſpeak a word of God to their Servants? how great a rarity is it for them to pray with them, and read the Scriptures before them, and to call upon them to mind what they read? who endeavours to convince their Servants of the corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their nature, and that they are born ſlaves of Sin and Satan? who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends Chriſt as the beſt Maſter, and commands his Servants to obey him? where is the Maſter to be found that is frequently and importunately endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to convince all under his charge of the neceſſity of faith in Chriſt, repentance, and a holy life? how little are Maſters concerned for God's ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and ſervice? nay, are there not ſome that are ſo far from minding the

Iſa. 57.24.</note> and ſcarce live a quiet life after it? and there are others that put their Servants upon ſin, that keep them up to work ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably late upon <hi>Saturday</hi>-nights, that they loſe half the Lords-day with ſleeping.

You can't imagine what obligations you may by this lay upon your Servants to fidelity; how acceptable this is to God, and how much reputation it will get you among men.

<pb n="458" facs="tcp:95740:236"/> ſhame, and the curſe of God for ever, you break the rules of equity and humanity, you forfeit your reputation, you go the likelieſt way to work to bring upon you diſmal calamities in your life, worſe at death, and worſt of all after death.<note place="margin">Mat. 25.26. Mat. 24.48, 49.50, 51.</note> O conſider this you that forget God, and your duty; and read that Scripture often you ſee quoted in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now crave leave to <hi>expoſtulate the caſe with Maſters about their duty;</hi> for I am loth to leave you, till I have prevailed with you to ſet to your work like Chriſtians. Sirs, you have heard your duty, and what have you to object againſt it? can you <hi>prove</hi> that <hi>that which</hi> I have <hi>deſired</hi> of you, is not <hi>required by God himſelf?</hi> Have I not <hi>proved</hi> what I have ſaid, by <hi>plain Scriptures?</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> not <hi>reaſon and humanity,</hi> as well as <hi>Chriſtianity, oblige</hi> you to the putting theſe duties in practice? have I not laid down many Motives to preſs you to your duty? have I not told you what a Maſter God is to his Servants? and put you upon being followers of him as dear children? Would it be any diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to you to follow ſo perfect and unerring an example? Doth not he teach, direct, help, encourage and reward his Servants? Is not he faithful to his promiſe, tender, pityful, and eaſie to be reconciled, and ready to forgive? And are you not very well pleaſed with theſe properties in God? And if this be amiable in God, why ſhould it not be lovely in you? God humbleth himſelf to look upon what is done on earth, and is it below you to look upon and take care of your Servants? What great difference is there, I pray, between you and them? Are they not of the ſame mould? And ſhortly your bones and skuls will not be diſtinguiſhed. Why did you take them into your Family, if you intended to take no more care of them than of a Dog? Was it not a piece of baſe falſhood in you to promiſe and engage what you never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to perform? Methinks I have a mind to debate this matter fairly with you, ſo as to leave you reſolved for your duty, or without any reaſon or excuſe for the neglect of it. Sirs, Is there any thing of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honeſty in what I have been perſwading you to? Is it a diſhoneſt thing to pray in your Families? to inſtruct them in the things of God? to be holy, diligent and faithful? What harm is there in all this? Would it do you or yours any injury? Would it hinder either your profit or pleaſure? Can <hi>godlineſs, which hath the promiſe of this life, and that which is to come,</hi> undo you? Should that which pleaſeth God diſpleaſe you? Is it an unpleaſant thing to ſee the beauty of holineſs in your Family, and to have yours ſerving God and you faithfully? Is it an unpleaſant thing to have God's commendation and peace? and to have good hopes that all yours are God's, and ſhall be delivered from the wrath to come, and be heirs of a Crown of glory? If you talk of pleaſure, no pleaſure like them that are in duty, and at the end of duty. Well now, What have you to ſay againſt your duty? You cry piſh, this is the way to be a ſlave, a mope, a fool. Is it true indeed, that to be enlarged for God in ones place is a ſlavery? how come ſuch to be ſo full of peace and joy? Is that the ſtate of ſlaves? no body is about to debar you of moderate
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:95740:236"/> liberty and recreation. But will you call nothing liberty and recreation, but that which expoſes you and yours to ruine? But if you take this courſe you ſhall be poor; if you and your Servants may not lye, cheat, break Sabbaths, you ſhall never be able to live. How then come ſo many honeſt men (that would not do any of all theſe things for a world) to live ſo well? Were <hi>Abraham, Joſhua, David, Cornelius,</hi> all ſuch poor men? If diligence, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, and holineſs undo men, what will make them? I hope you will not ſay that curſing, lying, fraud, idleneſs, ſenſuality, and careleſneſs, are better ways of thriving. Well, once more, what have you yet to ſay againſt what I have been perſwading you to? Will you now without delay bewail your former neglect? and in good earneſt ſet to your work, like a man, that in ſome meaſure knows the power of divine precepts, the worth of ſouls, and the greatneſs of that charge that lyeth upon you? O that there were in you ſuch a heart: O that all Maſters of Families were reſolved for that which humanity, reaſon, intereſt, reputation, and their comfort call for; as well as the law of God and men oblige them to; What bleſſed Families then ſhould we have? What noble Corporations? what glorious Cities? Might <hi>not Jehovah-Shammah be written then upon our Gates, and holineſs to the Lord upon every door?</hi> O when ſhall it once be?</p>
            <p>Now in hopes that ſome honeſt hearts are affected with what hath been ſpoken, and are deſirous to engage with all their might in their duties, I ſhall briefly add a few <hi>Helps</hi> for the better performance of their duty.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Get a heart inflamed with love to God.</hi> This will make you much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> more concerned for his honour than your own; this will cauſe you to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote his intereſt with vigor, and remove whatſoever may be prejudicial to it: love will break thorow difficulties, and make duty eaſie; love will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage you, body, ſoul, eſtate, head, tongue, hand, heart, all for God: then you can't live without prayer, and inſtructing your Servants. If the love of God dwell in you, I never fear the diſputing your duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Get a deep ſenſe of the worth of ſouls upon your ſpirits.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> he that made them values them highly; he that bought them and paid dearly for them, judged them worth his heart-blood; they that are wiſe, believe that their utmoſt care for them is not too much; their loſs is an irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable loſs, and if they are ſaved and ſecured, all loſſes are tolerable, light, inconſiderable. A due ſenſe of the worth of a ſoul would make you won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful careful to prevent its miſcarriage, greatly ſolicitous to make ſure its happineſs.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Beg of God a ſpirit of wiſdom and government, that you may know <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> how to go in and out before your houſe, like a man of prudence and Religion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Kings 3.9.

            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, <hi>Study the Scriptures much.</hi> Attend upon a conſcientious, powerful Miniſtry, and read ſome practical Books: there you will find the moſt <hi>excellent precepts;</hi> there you will meet with the <hi>moſt commendable preſidents;</hi> there you have the <hi>moſt powerful motives</hi> to your duty, the <hi>moſt ſucceſsful helps:</hi> In a word, there you will meet with the aſſiſtance of God's Spirit;<note place="margin">Pſal. 119.11.</note> by them you will be kept from any unrighteous thing.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>Do as you would be done by;</hi> remember <hi>what meaſure you mete to another,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 7.12.</note> 
               <hi>ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> I believe <hi>David</hi> would ſcarce have been ſo ready to paſs ſuch a ſentence as he did, if he had well conſidered who was at the bar; and it's likely a leſs puniſhment than burning might have been pronounced againſt <hi>Tamar,</hi> if <hi>Judah</hi> had remembred who was the Father of her Child.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>Take heed of pride, ſelfiſhneſs and ſenſuality.</hi> Theſe are the great make-bates; theſe make the world ſo full of confuſion and trouble; from hence come war and fightings;<note place="margin">Jam 4.1.</note> this brings ſuch diſorder, miſery and ſorrow unto Kingdoms, Cities, Houſes: if inſtead of theſe we had humility, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick-ſpiritedneſs,<note place="margin">Prov. 3.10.</note> temperance, the world would be quickly well mended with us.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, <hi>Think much upon your account, Death, Judgment, Heaven, Hell, and Eternity.</hi> I had almoſt ſaid, believe this truly, and think of it frequently, and be unfaithful if you can. I am perſwaded, that every wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful omiſſion of a known duty, and commiſſion of known ſin, hath much of atheiſm and unbelief in it: it is but yet a little while, and Maſter and Servant muſt be equal; death knows no difference; the worms and rottenneſs will ſeize as ſoon on the one as the other; and this might a little teach us humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and moderation. Conſider that account that muſt be given of our oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of ſervice, and every talent we are intruſted with. Suppoſe God's Meſſenger were juſt ready to knock at your door, and you were ſurely to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before God before to morrow morning, what meekneſs, diligence, faithfulneſs, would you then exerciſe? and how hardly brought to do any thing to hazard God's diſpleaſure? how full of good counſel to every body? why,<note place="margin">Luke 16.2. Heb. 9.27. Job 31.14.</note> how knoweſt thou, O man, but this hour may be thy laſt? This was that which did not a little prevail with <hi>Job</hi> to do his duty, and <hi>not to deſpiſe the cauſe of his hand-maid: What then,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>ſhould I do, when God ſhall riſe up? and when he viſiteth, what ſhall I anſwer him?</hi> Let death when he comes find you doing the beſt work,<note place="margin">Ar.

            </p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> I am now come to the laſt thing which I promiſed to do, and that is to ſhew, <hi>What is the Duty of Servants:</hi> and that I ſhall perform in the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as I did before,</p>
            <p n="1">1. By giving them ſome <hi>cautionary Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:95740:237"/>2. Some <hi>poſitive Directions,</hi> and preſſing theſe with ſome <hi>Motives,</hi> and give them ſome <hi>Helps</hi> for the better performance of their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall give <hi>Servants</hi> ſome <hi>cautionary Directions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Let Servants take heed of pride.</hi> This was the ſin of the Angels, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> this made them Devils; this was the ſin of our firſt Parents,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 3.6.</note> this made them rebellious to God. A humble heart is ready for any work or ſtate that God in his providence calls him to; any thing but ſin will down with a humble man. Remember, pride unfits for the ſervice of God and man, makes one think himſelf fitter to command than to be commanded: that makes one go on heavily with their work, impatient of reproof, ready to anſwer again, malepert, ſaucy, ready to commit other ſins to gratifie their pride. A proud Servant will ſcorn to be catechized, called to an account, or be kept under thoſe bounds that reaſon and Religion ſet. Humility doth no body any harm, brings no diſhonour or inconveniency, but is as good a ſecurity to reputation, comfort and profit, as any thing I know.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Take heed of diſobedience to the lawful commands of your Maſter.</hi> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Think not that your arrogance, bigneſs, and parentage, will bear you out. It may be you think ſcorn that your Maſter ſhould correct you, and you ſay in your mind, that you will give him as good as he brings: know this, that if you have a Maſter that may be low-ſpirited, weak, or poor, and it may be ſuch a one that is loth to deal with you as Law and Religion gives him leave; yet are you too ſtrong for God? Is he afraid of your ſwelling and big looks? Will he count you innocent? Is not your rebellion and diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to your Maſter diſobedience and rebellion againſt God? And can his purity ſuffer long, or his juſtice bear ſuch imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>y always without ſome ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of his diſpleaſure? Muſt the great ones of the world that break his Laws feel his power, and ſhall ſuch a deſpicable wretch as thou go unpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed? Remember, what is ſaid of diſobedience to the lawful commands of Magiſtrates, holds here, <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth, ſhall receive to himſelf damnation.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom 13.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Take heed of negligence, idleneſs, careleſneſs.</hi> By this you rob <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> your Maſter of what in honeſty you ſhould and might have got for him; by this you ſecretly waſte your Maſter, and anſwer not that truſt that is put in you, and is juſtly expected from you; by this you give juſt occaſion of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure to your Maſter; by this you break your promiſe made to your Maſter, and provoke God highly.<note place="margin">Mat. 5 26.</note> Remember what a ſentence the wicked ſlothful Servant muſt ſhortly hear.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Take heed of mere eye-ſervice.</hi> Is the eye of God nothing to <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> you? and his warnings inſignificant?<note place="margin">Col. 3.12.</note> Doth not he in plain words for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid this? O how many ſuch Servants be there, that when their Maſter is by, are very diligent, but when his back is turned, then how lazy, how wanton, how careleſs! Would you be ſerved thus your ſelves, if you were Maſters? Doth God take no notice at all? and if he do, how do you think he liketh ſuch doings? Is it a ſmall matter to make light of his preſence? and if it be ſo, you ſhall ſhortly find to your coſt, that his
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:95740:238"/> eye was more than your Maſter's upon you; and if you will not believe his knowledg, obſervation and eye, his hand ſhall ſhortly give you ſuch a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of both, as you ſhall not be able to ſlight.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Fifthly, <hi>Take heed of Lying.</hi> By a lye you deny God's knowledg; you make one fault two; you make your ſelf an enemy to humane ſociety: that is a ſin which is hateful to every honeſt man, and abominable to the Lord; the lyar ſhall be ſhut out of Heaven,<note place="margin">Prov. 6.17. Rev. 21.8.</note> and have his portion in that Lake that burns for ever. I ſpare to ſpeak how it ſpoils a man's credit, and feeds jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies in a Maſter, and maketh him ſcarce believe you when you ſpeak truth. O! little do Servants think what folly they are guilty of, by covering their faults with a lye: Little do they think how dear that ſin muſt coſt them either here by deep repentance, or hereafter by intolerable torments.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> Sixthly, <hi>Take heed of purloining or imbezeling any part of your Maſter's goods for your own uſe.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tit. 2.10. Luke 16.6.</note> Meddle with nothing but what is your own, and is allowed you; you would be loth any one ſhould call you a Thief. I pray then take care of that which will make you deſerve ſuch a name: do not conſent to any that are in the leaſt guilty in that kind; be not partners with a Thief, and make not your ſelf an acceſſory to another's wickedneſs by concealing any unfaithfulneſs of that nature in your fellow-ſervants, after you have roundly warned them your ſelf; eat not of the junkets that ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, wantonneſs and theft hath provided. If you would know what <hi>ſuch doings tend to,</hi> in a word I may tell you, <hi>they pamper luſt many times, end in uncleanneſs, murder, a priſon, a halter;</hi> and if that were all, it were not ſo bad in compariſon; by this you wrong God and man, fear your conſcience, and make way for a world of other ſins, and bring ſpeedy and ſure damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, except a thorow repentance prevent it.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> Seventhly, <hi>Take heed of bad companions, have no fellowſhip with the unfruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful works of darkneſs, but rather reprove them.</hi> O how many hopeful youths are blaſted by wicked company? I am not ignorant of the high pretences of love that ſuch may have, and what excuſes they may palliate their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with: but <hi>pleaſe none, to diſpleaſe God;</hi> never count him your friend, nor one that will do you a kindneſs, that would lead you to ſin, the devil, damnation.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> Eighthly, <hi>Take heed of diſcloſing your Maſter's ſecrets:</hi> do not ſpeak any thing that may wound his reputation; make no mention of his faults with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you are called to it lawfully, and then not without deep regret and trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, upon the account of God's honour and his ſoul. Some Servants make nothing of prating againſt their Maſters and Miſtreſſes behind their backs, little conſidering that this is a ſin that God will not over-look: is this inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuous? Is this like to mend him, and do him any good? Can you deſign God's glory by it? How do you think your Maſter will like it, if it ſhould come to his ears? This is neither pleaſing to God nor man.</p>
            <pb n="463" facs="tcp:95740:238"/>
            <p>Ninthly, <hi>Take heed of murmuring, diſcontent, and repining:</hi> Some Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> are of ſuch a temper, nothing will pleaſe them, their food is not dainty enough, their clothes not fine enough, and nothing contents them. The truth of it is, if you be of this proud, peeviſh, diſcontented humour; let me tell you, take it how you will, the worſt bit you eat, is too good for you; your betters are thankful, and fruitful with a great deal courſer diet: If your food be wholſom and ſufficient; your clothing warm and decent; remember that you have reaſon to bleſs God: Conſider well what you deſerve, and how glad ſome of your betters would be of your leavings; and ſuppoſe you be wronged, uſe lawful means for your redreſs: bleſſed be God this City hath excellent laws, and an injured Servant may be heard and helped; but if that may not be, and you be really injured, ſuppoſe you do your duty, and can't have a good word, nay, inſtead thereof many a heavy curſe, many a cauſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs blow: Suppoſe you are beaten for that for which you ſhould be commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; <hi>remember</hi> that <hi>patience,</hi> nay, <hi>thankfulneſs,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Matth. 5.13. 1 Pet. 2.20, 21.</note> would much better <hi>become you</hi> than <hi>murmuring; for if when you do well, and ſuffer for it, ye take it pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, this is acceptable with God: for even hereunto were ye called, becauſe Chriſt alſo ſuffered for us, leaving us an example that we ſhould follow his ſteps.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Laſtly, <hi>Take heed of ſinning to pleaſe your Maſter:</hi> If a Maſter command <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> one thing, and God another, you need not be long a determining which you ſhould obey. If your <hi>Maſter</hi> or <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> ſhould be ſo <hi>wicked</hi> as to <hi>put</hi> you <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſinning,</hi> let <hi>Joſeph's anſwer</hi> be <hi>yours, How ſhall I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> If your Maſter put you upon telling of lies, cheating, uſing of falſe weights or meaſures, breaking the Sabbath, or any thing that is clearly againſt God's honour, and your ſouls, you muſt firſt with all the humility and meekneſs you can for your ſoul, plead with him, urge the commands of God, the fear that you are in of diſpleaſing of him, and wounding your own conſcience; and if you can't by ſuch means pacifie him, tell him meekly of his danger in putting you upon ſin, and that,<note place="margin">Dan 3.18.</note> come on it what will, you neither can nor will obey him.</p>
            <p>I come now to lay down <hi>Servants duty poſitively.</hi>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Honour your Maſters;</hi> Labour to get and keep a true valuation of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them in your hearts: To this end <hi>obſerve</hi> what is <hi>excellent</hi> in them, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber your relation to them, their care over you; let this put you upon pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for them, and being affectionately concerned for them: let your <hi>words</hi> be always <hi>humble, meek,</hi> and <hi>obliging;</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, <hi>Obey your Maſters ſincerely, chearfully, univerſally,</hi> and <hi>conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as long as you ſtand in that relation to them:</hi> you muſt do what you do for your Maſters, as you would do it for your ſelf; your Maſter's concerns muſt be looked upon as your own.<note place="margin">Col. 3 22.</note> Yea, <hi>whatſoever you do, you muſt do it hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, as to the Lord;</hi> out of Conſcience and reſpect to God's command and honour: a flattering out-ſide ſervice without the heart, love, and good will, is neither acceptable to God, or man. Let your <hi>obedience</hi> alſo be <hi>chearful;</hi> go not about your work with an ill Will. Chearfulneſs would not be a little helpful to your ſelf; your work and time would then ſeem nothing in compariſon;<note place="margin">Eph. 6.7.</note> 
               <hi>God loves a chearful giver, a chearful wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, a chearful Sufferer:</hi> and I believe no Maſter but reckons himſelf bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſerved by him that goes chearfully and nimbly about his buſineſs, than one that doth obey but with a ſour diſcontented look, and a heavy counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>By this you can't but win upon your Maſters, and even compel them to love you, ſpeak well of you, and do well by you. Let <hi>your obedience</hi> alſo be <hi>univerſal,</hi> that is, in all things that God gives you leave. <hi>It</hi> is <hi>not</hi> for you to <hi>pick</hi> and <hi>chooſe,</hi> nor <hi>diſpute</hi> and <hi>grumble.</hi> Some Servants are for eaſie,<note place="margin">Col. 3.22.</note> pleaſant, and more honourable works, and here they may be commanded; but if they be at any time ſet about what liketh not their proud, lazy, ungodly humour, they are ready to put it off upon another; it may be to excuſe it with a Lye; perhaps, like rebels, flatly to deny obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. If a Maſter put him upon ſtrict Obſervation of the Lord's day, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on learning his Catechiſm, and minding his ſoul, then his baſe heart be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginneth to riſe, as if his Maſter did undervalue him, when he put him up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſervice of God; as if he judged it a liberty and priviledg to ſerve the Devil; and as if it were an unſufferable injury to be commanded to eſcape the wrath to come, and a drudgery to be call'd upon to look dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently after the ſecuring of holineſs and happineſs: Such as theſe look as if they were ripe for Hell, and would not be long before they would come thither: O that none of you that hear and read theſe lines may be found in this number: <hi>think nothing below you but ſin:</hi> your <hi>diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience</hi> can't be <hi>without ſin,</hi> if your <hi>Maſter command not a ſin.</hi> Laſtly, let <hi>your obedience</hi> be <hi>conſtant,</hi> it muſt begin and end with your relation to your Maſter.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, Another duty of the <hi>Servant</hi> towards his <hi>Maſter</hi> is <hi>faithfulneſs.</hi> Ingenuity calls for it:<note place="margin">Tit. 2.10.</note> he is unworthy of truſt that doth not anſwer it. The Maſter repoſeth much confidence in his Servant, and that ſhould oblige him to the greateſt fidelity. You muſt be <hi>faithful</hi> in <hi>word</hi> and <hi>deed.</hi> Speak well of your Maſter behind his back, and keep up his reputation and credit; and if you can't do that without falſneſs to God, if you can ſay no good by him, ſay no harm, except lawfully call'd to it; and if you do perceive your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's careleſneſs</hi> and <hi>wickedneſs</hi> makes him <hi>go down the wind,</hi> and neglect his duty, it may be <hi>faithfulneſs</hi> in you <hi>humbly</hi> to <hi>adviſe</hi> him in ſome ſuch lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as this: <hi>Sir, I intreat you give me leave in a few words to expreſs my true affection, reſpect, and faithfulneſs to you, and for God's ſake take it not unkindly at the hands of your poor Servant, if I acquaint you with that which I have
<pb n="465" facs="tcp:95740:239"/> with regret of heart obſerved too long in you; many a good Cuſtomer we loſe for want of your preſence in the Shop, your frequent abſence makes us have little to do, your credit (to my ſorrow God knows I ſpeak it) begins to grow much lower than it was wont to be, my Miſtreſs takes on heavily, we have but few choice wares, and no caſh, and little credit to fetch more, and we can't hold long at this rate; I beſeech you Sir leave off your company-keeping, and look into your Books, and conſider how things be: O how loth am I to ſee you or yours do other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than well! Sir, I beſeech you be not angry. I come not to teach you, but to intreat you, and humbly to deſire your ſerious conſideration of what I ſhall further crave leave to ſpeak; Sir, I beſeech you forget not us your poor Servants; we want your help in your Family, your inſtructions, your prayers, your holy examples would be no ſmall comfort to us: In thus doing I am perſwaded God would bleſs you, your trade and credit might ſoon be recovered, we ſhould ſerve you with joy, and bleſs God for you, and you and yours fare the better for ever.</hi> Now who but a mad man, or incarnate Devil, could chooſe but reliſh ſuch ſweet counſel as this, though from a Servant. Then you muſt be faithful in your <hi>deeds:</hi> give nothing away without your Maſter's leave; if you will be giving, give what is your own, give where and when God commands you, and ſpare not: labour to preſerve and increaſe your Maſter's eſtate all you can by good and lawful means: For this is that which is commanded by Chriſt in the Parable, hath his gracious approbation and plentiful reward, <hi>Well done good and faithful Servant, thou haſt been faithful in a little, enter thou into the joy of thy Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Your faithfulneſs muſt be further expreſſed by <hi>indeavouring all you can, the good of your Maſter's children:</hi> labour to inſtil into them good principles, incourage them in the learning their Books and Catechiſm, and obedience to their Parents, do what you can to prejudice them againſt ſin, and by your ſweet examples to be in love with God and godlineſs betimes. I might add alſo,<note place="margin">Zech. 5.2, 3. Tit. 2.10.</note> it is no ſmall expreſſion of faithfulneſs to <hi>do</hi> all the <hi>good</hi> you can for your <hi>fellow-Servants;</hi> give them good counſel, pray for them, help them all you may, and carry it ſo before them, that they may eaſily diſcern an excellency in you, and that you have a loving deſign upon them, and mean no more harm by all you ſpeak or do, but God's glory, your Maſter's profit, and comfort, and their ſouls ſalvation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Be very diligent in your Maſter's buſineſs;</hi> diſpatch what he ſets <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> you about with what ſpeed and expedition you can. A <hi>ſlothful</hi> Servant is a <hi>wicked</hi> Servant: by idleneſs and careleſsneſs you may do your Maſter more wrong in a day, than you may make up in a twelve-moneth. Beſides, you muſt remember your ſtrength and time is your Maſter's, and all of it muſt be improved for him, except ſo much as God calls for, or your Maſter giveth you.</p>
            <p>I come now to <hi>exhort Servants</hi> to the <hi>performance</hi> of theſe <hi>duties,</hi> and that I may, if poſſible, <hi>prevail,</hi> I ſhall lay before them a few <hi>Motives</hi> to inforce this duty.</p>

            </p>
            <p>And now Sirs, What will you do? Are you reſolved for your duty or no? Have I been all this while beating the air? Have I not ſhewed you what the Lord your God requireth of you? Have I deſired any thing of you but what I have given you Scripture-warrant for? and is Scripture nothing with you? Can you prove that I am miſtaken, and lay heavier burdens than God lays upon you? why then be at the trouble to turn to the Scriptures you ſee quoted in the Margent. I dare not charge any thing upon you but what I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord, and are you angry with God's commands? Dare you impeach your Maker of unjuſtice? What harm is there in any thing that he enjoyns you? Could you mend his Laws, and make them better? Which of his prohibitions can you find fault with? Are you diſpleaſed that God forbids pride and arrogance? Would you indeed have leave to be like the Devil? Do you deſire liberty to damn your ſelf, and bring confuſion into the houſe where you dwell? What a ſweet world ſhould we have, if every proud fool might have his will? What ſhould Maſters do with Servants, if their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands ſhould have no power upon them? Who but a mad man will judg idleneſs, careleſneſs and prodigality, commendable qualities in a Servant? Is it ſo unreaſonable a thing for a Maſter to expect ſomething to be done when his back is turned, as well as when he is preſent? What commerce could be carried on between man and man without truth? Are you deſirous that God ſhould give you leave to lie, and are you willing to have it known that you are of this mind? Is it a ſlavery to have your hands tied from picking and ſtealing? Would you have a licenſe to ſteal, and a badg of your priviledg that every one might read? Are wicked profligate wretches the beſt companions? Can you deſire their company in the other world? Is back-biting threatned by God in his Word, and ſhall it be excuſed in you? How would you like one that were always grumbling, and never content nor pleaſed? Is this tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per hateful in another, and lovely in you? Is there any wrong done you, when God bids you have a care of hazarding your ſoul to get your Maſter a groat? Which of all the Cautions that I have given you, are really prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial to your true credit, pleaſure, or profit? Well,<note place="margin">Epictetus.</note> I perceive you have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nay I am ſure you can have nothing juſtly to object againſt them; And dare you now venture ſtill to be proud, diſobedient, idle? Do Sinners venture
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:95740:241"/> on ſtill, in ſpite of Maſter, Miniſter, and the divine prohibitions; but be it upon thy peril, for as ſure as God lives he will call you to judgment. Will half an hours junketting make amends for the loſs of a ſoul for ever? What is there in all the duties that are commanded that you have any thing to object againſt? Are you troubled that your Maſter muſt be honoured? Should we not have ſweet doings if Maſters and Servants were fellows? If you your ſelf ſhould ever live to be a Maſter, tell me plainly, how would you like it to be ſlighted by your Servant? Is <hi>Obedience</hi> a word you miſlike? What is a Servant good for without obedience? What is he but a burden to the earth, worſe than the dung it ſelf? Are faithfulneſs and diligence diſpleaſing to you? And I pray, who is pleaſed with unfaithfulneſs and idleneſs, but wicked ones, fools, and the Devil? And are ſuch as theſe to be pleaſed rather than God, Parents, Maſters? Well once more, What have you to ſay againſt your du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, why it may not be practiſed ſpeedily? Have you weightier Arguments againſt it, than I have for it? Come, produce your ſtrong reaſon, and ſhew your ſelf a man. Are the precepts of the mighty God nothing? Are his injunctions of no validity at all? Are you not at all concerned for his honour? Is the gratifying a curſed luſt a matter of greater importance and neceſſity than God's glory? So little he will take care of himſelf, and raiſe him ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour out of your ſhame and ruine, if you regard not God. Have you no reſpect to your ſelf? Will your peace, reputation and profit, prevail nothing with you? Is the quiet of the Family, the glory of a City, the proſperity and ſafety of a Kingdom, a ſmall matter with you? Why all this ſeems in ſome meaſure wrapped up in Servants fidelity. Have the promiſes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the great Maſter little efficacy? Is Heaven, glory and eternal hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, worth nothing? The truth of it is, if all this be nothing, I know not what is ſomething. But what do you think of judgment, wrath, and Hell? If the former Motives ſignifie little, doth this ſo too? Then I muſt conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſs I know not what to add more; but you muſt take your courſe, and take what follows: but know this, that you were warned, and counſel'd, and pleaded with, till you had nothing to ſay, or if you had, I am ſure no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to purpoſe, and that ſhortly you will be ſilenced. But God forbid that all Servants ſhould be of this mind, ſome, yea many, I hope better of, though I thus ſpeak; but the general complaint that ſounds in our ears, makes us judg ſuch reaſonings as theſe not altogether needleſs. And now for the ſakes of ſome that I hope reſolve for duty, I ſhall add a <hi>Help</hi> or two for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of their duty, and ſo I ſhall conclude.</p>
            <p> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Firſt, If you would be <hi>good Servants, labour to be Chriſt's Free-men.</hi> Caſt off the ſervice of Satan,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.22. Rom. 6.18.</note> and be no longer commanded by him: remember how cruel, how falſe, how unreaſonable a Maſter he is; conſider what can he pay his Servants in at laſt; and know 'tis impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſerve two contrary Maſters at once. Be not ſervants to your luſts; caſt them off as things that will not profit, and inſtead thereof <hi>yield your ſelves to the Lord,</hi> and <hi>ſerve him with all your might;</hi> and ſo <hi>be holy as he is holy, in all manner of converſation,</hi> and <hi>the grace of God will teach you to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, and to live holily, righteouſly and ſoberly in
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:95740:241"/> this preſent world;</hi> that will teach you to reverence, obey, to be faithful and diligent to your earthly Maſter, <hi>as knowing your labours ſhall not be in vain in the Lord.</hi> If the fear of God be but in your hearts, it will teach you wiſdom, make you hate every evil way, and to do that which is honeſt and juſt to your Maſter. A <hi>good</hi> Chriſtian can't be a <hi>bad</hi> Servant.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Be not a ſtranger to the Bible.</hi> When others are fooliſhly ſquan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> away their time, do you ſolace your ſelf with the Word of God; let that be much read by you, and labour to lie under the powerful impreſſion of the prohibitions, precepts, promiſes, threatnings and examples that are there, and then you can't do amiſs.<note place="margin">Epictetuc.</note> I remember it was the advice of an excellent Moraliſt, that we ſhould <hi>oft</hi> in <hi>our actions think</hi> what <hi>Socrates, Zeno, Plato, or ſome wiſe Philoſopher,</hi> would <hi>do</hi> in <hi>ſuch</hi> a <hi>caſe.</hi> I had rather you would think oft, what would ſuch a one as <hi>Eliezer</hi> the Servant of <hi>Abraham</hi> do in ſuch a caſe; read how he carried himſelf, how naturally he was concerned for his Maſters intereſt, how diligently, faithfully and prudently he goes to work, how importunately he addreſſes himſelf to God, and how heartily he prays for proſperity and ſucceſs in his Maſters buſineſs, how much he advanceth his Maſters credit, and how naturally concerned for his Maſters Son, and with what integrity and expedition he diſpatcheth his buſineſs; go you and do like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. The <hi>example</hi> of <hi>Joſeph</hi> and <hi>Obadiah,</hi> who were <hi>good</hi> in <hi>bad houſes,</hi> are <hi>well worth</hi> your <hi>conſideration:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 8.9</note> I might add the example of the <hi>Centurions Servant,</hi> whom his Maſter giveth this character of, <hi>That he was as ready to obey as he was to command.</hi> I ſhall add an example or two more, though you find them not in the Scripture, yet they are according to the Scripture; one of them I knew well: A certain Servant, that it's probable was converted by the Father, was ſo faithful, diligent, lively, full of ſpiritual diſcourſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate prayers for the children and family, that it proved a means of the converſion of ſome of them; here's a Servant worth gold! Another Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant I knew good for Earth and Heaven too, that after other indeavours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a fellow-Servant, ſpent ſome time at midnight to pray for him, and being very importunate, the voice was heard into the next Chamber, where he lay, at which, out of curioſity he roſe in his ſhirt to liſten, and heard one pray for him, by which prayer he was converted. Study therefore the Scriptures, and preſent the examples you find there to your imitation.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Get a ſtrong love to your Maſter.</hi> Love will put you upon any work; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> love will ſet head, hand and feet a working, and tongue a going; love makes heavy things light, hard things eaſie; love is a mighty Engine, it can do any thing; love will make you forget length of time. In a word, love is like to make one faithful, obedient and diligent.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Be humble, meek and patient.</hi> The <hi>humble</hi> man <hi>thinks nothing <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> below</hi> him which is his <hi>duty;</hi> and if to <hi>do</hi> his <hi>duty</hi> be to <hi>be vile,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.4. 1 Pet. 1.19.</note> he <hi>will</hi> yet be <hi>vilerſtill.</hi> The humble God will guide, exalt and ſave. Humility diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſeth none but the Devil.</p>
            <pb n="470" facs="tcp:95740:242"/>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>Be much in good company, and hearken to their advice.</hi> Be conſtant in prayer, and beg of God to make you faithful, and be conſcientious in your attendance upon a powerful faithful Miniſtry. In a word, live much in the thought of your great account, and in thus doing, I queſtion not but you will find grace to be faithful to God and man, and be accepted of your Maſter here, and rewarded by God hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus I have according to my poor ability <hi>ſet</hi> the <hi>duty</hi> of <hi>Maſters</hi> and <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants</hi> before them.

            </p>
            <p>I will not ſpend time to acquaint you with the methods of their generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Every man knows he hath a thinking faculty, and ſome inward concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which he calls thoughts, he knows that he thinks, and what he thinks; though he be not able to deſcribe the manner of their formation in the womb, or remember it any more than the ſpecies of his own face in a glaſs.</p>
            <p>In this diſcourſe let us firſt ſee what kind of thoughts are ſins.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively. <hi>A ſimple apprehenſion of ſin is not ſinful.</hi> Thoughts receive not a ſinfulneſs barely from the object: That may be unlawful to be acted, which is not unlawful to be thought of. Though the will cannot will ſin without guilt, yet the underſtanding may appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend ſin without guilt; for that doth no more contract a pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the bare apprehenſion, than the eye doth by the reception of the ſpecies of a loathſom object. Thoughts are morally evil, when they have a bad <hi>principle,</hi> want a due <hi>end,</hi> and converſe with the object in a wrong <hi>manner.</hi> Angels cannot but underſtand the offence which diſplaced the <hi>Apoſtate Stars</hi> from heaven; but they know not ſin <hi>cognitione practicâ:</hi> Glorified Saints may conſider their former ſins, to enhance their admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:95740:244"/> of pardoning mercy. <hi>Chriſt</hi> himſelf muſt needs underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Devils temptation; yet Satan's ſuggeſtions to his thoughts were as the vapors of a jakes mixed with the Sun-beams, without a defilement of them. Yea God himſelf, who is infinite purity, knows the Object of his own acts, which are converſant about ſin; as his holineſs in forbidding it, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in permitting, mercy in pardoning, and juſtice in puniſhing. But thoughts of ſin in Chriſt, Angels, and glorified Saints, are accompanied with an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrency of it, without any combuſtible matter in them to be kindled by it. As our thoughts of a divine object are not gracious, unleſs we love and delight in it; ſo a bare apprehenſion of ſin is not poſitively criminal, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we delight in the object apprehended. As a ſinful Object doth not render our thoughts evil, ſo a divine object doth not render them good; becauſe we may think of it with undue circumſtances, as unſeaſonably, coldly, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And thus there is an imperfection in the beſt thought a regene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate man hath; for though I will ſuppoſe he may have a ſudden ejaculation without the mixture of any poſitive impurity, and a ſimple apprehenſion of ſin with a deteſtation of it, yet there is a defect in each of them; becauſe 'tis not with that raiſed affection to God, or intenſe abhorrency of ſin, as is due from us to ſuch objects, and whereof we were capable in our primitive ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2"> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 2. Poſitively. Our thoughts may be branched into firſt motions, or ſuch that are more voluntary.</p>
            <p n="1"> 
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 1. <hi>Firſt motions;</hi> Thoſe unfleched thoughts, and ſingle threads, before a multitude of them come to be twiſted and woven into a diſcourſe: ſuch as skip up from our natural corruption, and ſink down again as fiſh in a river. Theſe are ſins though we conſent not to them; becauſe, though they are without our <hi>will,</hi> they are not againſt our <hi>nature;</hi> but ſpring from an inordinate frame, of a different hue from what God implanted in us. How can the firſt ſprouts be good, if the root be evil? Not only the thought formed, but the very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, or firſt imagination is evil. Voluntarineſs is not neceſſary to the <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence</hi> of a ſin, though it be to the <hi>aggravation</hi> of it. 'Tis not my Will or Knowledg,<note place="margin">Gen. 19.33, 35</note> which doth make an act ſinful, but God's prohibition. <hi>Lot</hi>'s in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt was not uſhered by any deliberate conſent of his Will; yet who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it to be a ſin, ſince he ſhould have exerciſed a ſeverer command over him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, than to be overtaken with drunkenneſs, which was the occaſion of it? Original ſin is not <hi>effectivè</hi> voluntary in infants; becauſe no act of the will is exerted in an infant about it: Yet it is voluntary <hi>ſubjectivè;</hi> becauſe it doth <hi>inhaerere voluntati.</hi> Theſe motions may be ſaid to be voluntary <hi>negatively,</hi> becauſe the Will doth not ſet bounds to them, and exerciſe that ſoveraign do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the operations of the ſoul, which it ought to do, and wherewith it was at it's firſt creation inveſted. Beſides though the Will doth not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately conſent to them, yet it conſents to the occaſions, which adminiſter ſuch motions; and therefore, according to the rule, that <hi>cauſa cauſae eſt cauſa cauſati,</hi> may be juſtly charged upon our ſcore.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Voluntary thoughts,</hi> which are the bloſſoms of theſe motions. Such that have no lawful object, no right end, not governed by reaſon, eccentrick, diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly in their motions, and like the jarring ſtrings of an untun'd Inſtrument. The
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:95740:244"/> meaneſt of theſe floating phancies are ſins; becauſe we act not in the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of them, as rational creatures: and what we do without reaſon, we do againſt the law of our creation, which appointed reaſon for our guide, and the underſtanding to be <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Theſe may be reduced to three heads,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of God. 2. Of our ſelves. 3. Of others.</p>
            <p n="1">I. In regard of God. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Cold thoughts of God;</hi> When no affection is raiſed in us by them. When <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> we delight not in God the object of thoſe thoughts, but in the thought it ſelf, and operation of our mind about Him, conſiſting of ſome quaint notion of God of our own conceiving. This is to delight in the <hi>act</hi> or <hi>manner</hi> of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, not in the <hi>object</hi> thought of; And thus theſe thoughts have a folly and vanity in them.

            <p>There is no ſin committed in the world, but is hatched in one or other of theſe thoughts. But beſide theſe, there are a multitude of other volatile con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceits, like ſwarms of gnats buzzing about us, and preying upon us, and as frequent in their ſucceſſions, as the curlings of the water upon a ſmall breath of wind, one following another cloſe at the heels. The mind is no more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with thoughts, than the firſt matter is with forms; continually ſhifting one for another, and many times the nobler for the baſer: as when upon the putrefaction of a human body part of the Matter is endued with the form of Vermin. Such changeable things are our minds, in leaving that which is good for that which is worſe, when they are enveigled by an active phancy, and Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lam affections. This <hi>madneſs is in the hearts of men while they live,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccleſ 9.3.</note> and ſtarts a thouſand frenzies in a day. At the beſt our phancy is like a <hi>Carrier's bag,</hi> ſtuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed with a world of Letters, having no dependence upon one another; ſome containing buſineſs, and others nothing but froth.</p>
            <p>In all theſe thoughts there is a further guilt in three reſpects, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>Delight,</hi> 2. <hi>Contrivance,</hi> 3. <hi>Reacting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Delight</hi> in them. The very tickling of our phancy by a ſinful motion, though without a formal conſent, is a ſin; becauſe it is a degree of compla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency in an unlawful object. When the mind is pleaſed with the ſubject of the thought, as it hath a tendency to ſome ſenſual pleaſure, and not ſimply in the thought it ſelf, as it may enrich the underſtanding with ſome degree of knowledg. The thought indeed of an evil thing may be without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the evil of it; as <hi>Philoſophers</hi> delight in making experiments of poiſonous Creatures, without delighting in the poiſon, as it is a noxious qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. We may delightfully think of ſin without guilt, not delighting in it as ſin, but as God by his wiſe providential ordering extracts Glory to himſelf, and good to his Creature. In this caſe, though a ſinful act be the <hi>material object</hi> of this pleaſure, yet 'tis not the <hi>formal object:</hi> becauſe the delight is not ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated in the ſin, but in God's ordering the event of it to his own glory. But an Inclination to a ſinful motion, as it gratifies a corrupt affection, is ſin: becauſe every inclination is a malignant tincture upon the affections, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in its own nature an averſion from God, and teſtifying ſin to be an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able object. And without queſtion, there can be no inclination to any thing, without ſome degree of pleaſure in it: becauſe it is impoſſible we can encline to that, which we have a perfect abhorrency of. Hence it
<pb n="478" facs="tcp:95740:246"/> follows, that every inclination to a ſinful motion is <hi>Conſenſus inchoatus,</hi> or a Conſent in <hi>Embryo:</hi> though the act may prove abortive. If we think of any unlawful thing with pleaſure, and imagine it either in <hi>fieri,</hi> or <hi>facto eſſe,</hi> it brings a guilt upon us, as if it were really acted. As when upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſuch a man's being my enemy, I phancy robbers rifling his goods, and cutting his throat, and rejoyce in this revengeful thought, as if it were really done,
'tis a great ſin: becauſe it teſtifies an approbation of ſuch a but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery, if any man had will and opportunity to commit it. And though it be a ſuppoſition, yet the act of the mind is really the ſame it would be, if the ſinful act I think of were performed. Or when a man conditionally thinks with himſelf, I would ſteal ſuch a man's goods, or kill ſuch a perſon, if I could eſcape eſcape the puniſhment attending it, it is as if he did rob and murder him: becauſe there is no impediment in his will to the commiſſion of it, but only in the outward circumſtances. Nay though it be a mere <hi>Ens intentiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> or <hi>rationis,</hi> which is the object of the thought: yet the act of the mind is real, and as ſignificant of the inclination of the Soul, as if the object were real too: As if a man hath an unclean motion at the ſight of a picture, which is only a compoſition of well mixed and well ordered colours: or at the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the Idea of a beauty fram'd in his own phancy: 'tis as much uncleanneſs as if it were terminated in ſome ſuitable object: the hinderance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not in the will, but in the inſufficiency of the object to concur in ſuch an act. Now as the more delight there is in any holy ſervice, the more precious it is in it ſelf, and more grateful to God: ſo the more pleaſure there is in any ſinful motion, the more malignity there is in it.</p>

Doth not the <hi>Law</hi> oblige man as a <hi>ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> creature? Shall it then leave that part, which doth conſtitute him rational, to ſleeting and giddy fancies? No, it binds the ſoul as the principal agent, the body only as the inſtrument. For if it were given only for the ſenſitive part, without any reſpect to the rational, it would concern brutes as well as men, which are as capable of a rational command, and a voluntary obedience, as man without the conduct of a rational ſoul. It exacts a conformity of the whole man to God, and prohibits a difformity; and therefore engageth chiefly the inward part, which is moſt the man.

Would it not be work enough for our thoughts all the day to travel over the length, breadth, heighth, and depth of the love of Chriſt? Would the greatneſs of the journey give us leiſure to make any ſtarts out of the way? Having ſettled the Theme for all the day, we ſhall find occaſional aſſiſtances, even from worldly buſineſſes; as Scholars, who have ſome Exerciſe to make, find helps in their own courſe of reading, though the Book hath no deſign'd reſpect to their proper Theme. Thus by imploying our minds about one thing chiefly, we ſhall not only hinder them from vain excurſions, but make even common objects to be oyl to our good thoughts, which otherwiſe would have been fuel for our bad. Such generous liquor would ſcent our minds and converſations all the day; that whatſoever motion came into our hearts, would be tinctured with this ſpirit, and ſavour of our morning thoughts: as veſſels having been filled with a rich wine, communicate a reliſh of it to the liquors afterward put into them.

A bare ſpeculation will tire the ſoul, and without application, and preſſing upon the will and affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, will rather chill, than warm devotion. 'Tis only by this means, that we ſhall have the efficacy of truth in our wills, and the ſweetneſs in our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, as well as the notion of it in our underſtandings. The more opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive any truth is in this manner upon us, the leſs power will other thoughts have to interrupt, and the more diſdainfully will the heart look upon them, if they dare be impudent. Never therefore leave thinking of a ſpiritual ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, till your heart be affected with it. If you think of the evil of ſin, leave not till your heart loath it; if of God, ceaſe not till it mount up in admirati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him. If you think of his mercy, melt for abuſing it; if of his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraignty, awe your heart into obedient reſolutions; if of his preſence, double your watch over your ſelf. If you meditate on Chriſt, make no end till your hearts love him; if of his death, plead the value of it for the juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of your perſons, and apply the vertue of it for the ſanctification of your natures. Without this practical ſtamp upon our affections, we ſhall have light ſpirits, while we have opportunity to converſe with the moſt ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous objects. We often hear fooliſh thoughts breathing out themſelves in a houſe of mourning, in the midſt of Coffins, and trophies of death, as if men were confident they ſhould never die; whereas none are ſo ridiculous as to aſſert they ſhall live for ever.

Let it wind up your heart in the praiſes of him, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered you from it. Is it to tempt you from duty? Endeavour to be more zealous in the performance of it. Is it to ſet you at a diſtance from God? Reſolve to be a light ſhining the clearer in that darkneſs, and let it excite you to a cloſer adherence to him.

Let Satan's fiery darts enflame your love rather than your Luſt, and like a skilful Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, make uſe of the violence of the winds, and raging of the Sea to further you in your ſpiritual voyage. This is to beat the Devil and our own hearts
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:95740:256"/> with their own weapons; who will have little ſtomach to fight with thoſe arms wherewith they ſee themſelves wounded. There is not a remembrance of the worſt objects but may be improved to humility and thankfulneſs; as St. <hi>Paul</hi> never thought of his old perſecuting, but he ſank down in humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and mounted up in admirations of the riches of grace.</p>

A fourth ſort of directions is concerning good motions; whether they <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> ſpring naturally from a gracious principle, or are peculiarly breath'd in by the ſpirit.

'tis a ſtranger. You know not but you may entertain an Angel, yea, ſomething greater than an Angel, even the Holy Ghoſt. Open all the powers of your ſouls, like ſo many Organ-pipes, to receive the breath of this Spirit when he blows upon you. 'Tis a ſign of an agreeableneſs between the heart and heaven, when we cloſe with, and preſerve ſpiritual motions. We need not ſtand long to examine them: they are evident by their holineſs, ſweetneſs, and ſpirituality. We may as eaſily diſcern them, as we can exotick plants from thoſe that grow naturally in our own ſoil: or as a palate at the firſt taſte can diſtinguiſh between a rich and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous wine, and a rough water. The thoughts inſtill'd by the Spirit of adoption are not violent, tumultuous, full of perturbation: but, like himſelf, gentle and dove-like ſolicitings,<note place="margin">Gal 5 22.</note> warm and holy impulſes, and (when cheriſhed) leave the ſoul in a more humble, heavenly, pure, and believing temper than they found it. 'Tis a high aggravation of ſin to <hi>reſiſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Acts 7.51. Yet we may quench his motions by neglect, as well as by oppoſition, and by that means loſe both the profit and pleaſure, which would have attended the entertainment.

The more ſuch ſprouts are planted and nouriſhed in us, the leſs room will ſtinking weeds have to root themſelves, and diſperſe their influence. And for thy own good thoughts, feed them, and keep them alive, that they may not be like a blaze of ſtraw which takes birth, and expires the ſame minute. Brood upon them, and kill them not; as ſome birds do their young ones,<note place="margin">

'Tis not enough to give them a bare reception, and forbear the ſmothering of them; but we muſt conſider what affections are proper to be rais'd by them, either in the ſearch of ſome truth, or performance of ſome duty. Thoſe gleams, which ſhoot into us on the ſudden, have ſome leſſon ſeal'd up in them, to be opened, and learned by us.

Well then, lye not at anchor, when a freſh gale would fill thy ſails, but lay hold of the preſent opportunity.

Therefore when the Spirit renews in our mind, a Goſpel-truth, let us turn it into a preſent plea, and be God's remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brancers of His own promiſes, as the Spirit is our remembrancer of divine truths. We need not doubt ſome rich fruit of the application at ſuch a ſeaſon: ſince without queſtion the impreſſions the Spirit ſtamps upon us, are as much according to <hi>God's will,</hi>

            <p>For expoſition enquire</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is this corrupt ſpeech that is forbid?</p>
            <p>Some reſtrain it to filthy unclean ſpeech, others extend it to all wicked ſpeech; I conceive it reaches alſo unto idle, empty, unprofitable Diſcourſe, and to this apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion I am led by the import of the Original word (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) which ſignifies rotten; and am further confirmed by the Antitheſis in the latter clauſe of the Verſe <hi>(But that which is good to the uſe of Edifying)</hi> where he ſeems to inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that the deſign of Diſcourſe being the Edification of one another; as rotten unſound Wood, that will bear no ſtreſs, is not put into Building, ſo neither ſhould ſapleſs words, that have no heart in them, be uſed in our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing. Down-right evil words may be here condemned eminently, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean filthy words eſpecially, but idle empty words I apprehend alſo inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as in <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.4. they are particularly expreſſed <hi>(neither filthineſs nor fooliſh talking.)</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. What is underſtood by its goodneſs to the uſe of edifying?</p>
            <p>In the Original it ſounds pretty harſh <hi>(to the edifying of uſe)</hi> which I take to be an Hebraiſm, and aequivalent to uſeful Edification. Some way or other profitable our Diſcourſe ſhould be, to the imbettering and not worſting of our ſelves, or Companions; and the goodneſs here ſpoken of, is its aptneſs to this end. Though our Diſcourſe hath a higher or lower degree of goodneſs in it, as it promotes and refers to a greater or leſſer good; That which refers to the imbettering of our Souls, is eminently
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:95740:259"/> good Diſcourſe; and that which vulgarly carries the name of it: But we are not confined to this; if the Body, the Eſtate, the name of our Brother be induſtriouſly promoted, yea, if his mind be innocently cheared, the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe by this Rule ſeems allowed and approved.</p>
            <p n="3">3. What is that Grace that ſhould be ſtill miniſtred by it?</p>
            <p>Some underſtand it of Grace in the moſt noble ſenſe, the begetting and ſtrengthening which, by our converſe we ſhould ſtill be endeavouring; but I cannot apprehend this ſingly meant, nor do I think the Apoſtle here ſpeaks, of the adaequate ſcope of our Diſcourſe, for that he ſeems more generally to have laid down in the words laſt explained; But I conceive he points at a by end, that will reſult upon our eying the fore-mentioned grand end, intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that if our words are ſo uſeful, they are likely to be grateful to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and deſervedly procure us grace and favour with them; Or elſe he here directs us, ſo to ſeaſon our ſpeech that it may be ſavoury, and have a good reliſh with all men; a reliſh of our wiſdom, of our Charity, or ſome ſuch like gift or Grace, that God hath beſtowed upon us; And this way the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſeems to expound himſelf, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.6. <hi>(Let your ſpeech be always with Grace, ſeaſoned with Salt)</hi> the one is exegetical of the other if I miſtake not: we ſhould not ſpeak as we ſpit, what comes next, but have that reſpect to mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and manner, as no man ſhall reaſonably be diſguſted at what we ſay, whereby he hopes <hi>we may be able to anſwer every one,</hi> attaining by this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice <hi>the tongue of the Learned;</hi> The Salt there adviſed is to prevent the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trefaction before cautioned.

               </label> How we may, and ſhould order and govern our Tongues, that we may not by them talk away our Religion, but rather evidence, and confirm our holy profeſſion?</p>
            <p>In handling which I would proceed by theſe gradations, ſhewing,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="505" facs="tcp:95740:259"/>1. That there is a great difficulty in governing the Tongue; it is noted as a very unruly Member, beyond other Members, yea, beyond every thing elſe, he ſpeaks even deſpairingly of our maſtering it, <hi>James</hi> 3.7, 8. <hi>Every kind of Beaſts, and of Birds, and of Serpents, and things in the Sea is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind; but the Tongue can no man tame, it is an unruly evil.</hi> We find this by too ſad Experience, perſons that in their Actions are blameleſs, are frequently in their words very faulty, and ſcarce reckon themſelves guilty. The double Guard that Nature hath ſet over it, of lips to ſecure and Impriſon it, of Teeth as it were to puniſh it, ſuffices not to reſtrain it. It breaks through all the bounds of God and Nature, and hardly acknowledges any Maſter.</p>
            <p>Now the Tongue is ſo ungovernable,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that it is a proud Member, being with its endowments of rational Diſcourſe peculiar to man, whereas our other Members are generally common to Beaſts; hereon we pride our ſelves hugely in it, <hi>David</hi> calls it <hi>his Glory,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 57.8.</note> and it is certainly an Organ of great Excellency and Uſe, without which we were uncapable of Communion and Commerce, the chief advantages of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane life; all of us have on this Account a great Opinion of it, are much pleaſed to hear our ſelves talk, promiſe our ſelves great matters from our Tongue, that ſhall get us favour, that ſhall get us honour, when we deſpair in every thing, we have hope in that; That can make evil good by its plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and that can make good evil by its reproaches, that ſhall revenge us on our Enemy that is otherwiſe too hard for us, and defend us at the Bar when ought is objected againſt us, you cannot imagine what confidence men have in their Tongues, and therefore no wonder they ſtand up ſo for the Liberty of them. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. <hi>With our Tongues will we prevail, our lips are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> Herein lyes the impotent man's great power, and hereby he thinks to be even with every one, the hands many times are bound and can do nothing, it is a relief and pleaſure that we can ſay what we liſt, if not before the face, yet behind the back, truly or falſly. The Tongue's power lyes in its Liberty, which makes us ſo loth to have it abridged. When no way elſe <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Enemies could hurt him, by this Dart they thought to wound him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 20.10. They therefore that are ſeebleſt, and moſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of other weapons, are lotheſt we ſhould blunt or any way reſtrain them in the uſe of this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that the Tongue is an Active Member, much beyond any others; opportunity muſt be waited for their Actings, wearineſs is contracted by their Actings, but the Tongue is alwayes ready, and never weary, that it muſt be continually watched.</p>
            <p>Active this Member is in it ſelf; compared therefore to a fire, <hi>James</hi> 3.6. <hi>The Tongue is a fire,</hi> its volatility and Activity, as alſo its impartiality in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Friend or Foe, is hereby noted.</p>
            <p>Actuated alſo it is by many ſtrong Springs within, that it is hard ſtopping its motion, or finding out ſometimes whence it has its Impreſſion. Pride, Anger, Envy, Malice, Hatred, all the wickedneſs of the Heart ſeeks its vent by the Tongue, and falls in upon it like ſtreams on a Mill-wheel, that of
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:95740:260"/> it ſelf is diſpoſed to perpetual motion; how can it but move, and how can it regularly move, that is impelled by ſuch various and vicious principles? The Tongue, ſays he, <hi>James</hi> 3.8. <hi>is full of deadly poyſon;</hi> all the ill hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours are gathered to it, hence it is a great difficulty to cure or check the malignity of it.</p>
            <p>And yet moreover it is acted and vehemently incited from without; the Devil is ſtill provoking of it without occaſion, and by preſenting occaſions to ſhew its tricks, ſo that there is little hope of its lying ſtill, or acting according to God's will. What can be expected from a Member that for its own Activity is a fire, that is fed with ſuch fewel, that is enflamed by ſuch an Incendiary? For ſo the Apoſtle tells us, <hi>that it is ſet on fire of Hell,</hi> James 3.6.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that it is not aware of its iniquity, what miſchief it does, how guilty it is; whereon it is very hard either to prevent it or repent of it. What words did they drop, and yet how do they ſtand up in the defence of them, as if nothing had been ſaid amiſs? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.13, 14, 15. <hi>Your words have been ſtout againſt me, ſaith the Lord, yet ye ſay, what have we ſpoken ſo much againſt thee?</hi> The Tongue is never in fault, if we might be Judg, and that its own Advocate; even they that are ſevereſt in cenſuring others words, have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſomething to ſay for their own. And the inſenſibleneſs of Tongue-ſins may ariſe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In regard of its ſleight and nimbleneſs in its actings, eſpecially when it Acts in an accuſtomed way, it vaſtly out-runs our Obſervation, as in your ordinary Curſers and Swearers you may ſee. Not one in ten of their horrible Execrations is ſo much as noted by them, they patter them over, as a Parrot doth his leſſon, without any preſent ſenſe or after-reflection, and are ready if haſtily charged, to ſwear they did not ſwear, and curſe themſelves if they curſed.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In regard of the imperceptible wound it makes, it draws no blood, it doth not immediately invade its Neighbour's Goods, and it cannot ſee what hurt it does, any wound it makes, it thinks it can lick it well again ſtraight; but therein is a great deceit, it may lick its own lips and think ſo, and that ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily ſuffices: Alas! can they not bear one of its laſhes? We did but talk, as we heard, as we thought, and that is nothing till it comes to be our own caſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In regard of the pleaſure it takes in all it doth, that drowns all ſenſe of evil in it, it cannot be ſin that taſts ſo ſweet. Whereas many other ſins are not Acted without great pains, men <hi>draw at them like Horſes,</hi> they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of us, as the Devils out of the poor men, <hi>tormenting and tearing of us,</hi> that we are ſenſible of the evil of them: Theſe ſins of the Tongue are vented with eaſe, we are not waſted, nor any way wearied by them; yea, they eaſe us in their venting, we were big to be delivered of them, that ſome pleaſure comes that way to us; and ſeveral things in us are mainly tickled by them; now Pride on a conceit of wit, then profaneneſs, in our very boldneſs. Again, Malice and Revenge; that it hath wreak't it ſelf with ſuch eaſineſs: one Devil or other is ſtill ſet on laughing in us, and thus theſe ſins go down merrily with us, and are little ſuſpected or cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:95740:260"/> by us, they look too pleaſantly to mean any harm to us. Thus you find ſome tickled by thoſe ſpeeches, through which others were damned. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>Spots they are and blemiſhes</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) <hi>ſporting themſelves with their own deceivings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. In regard of the applauſe it ordinarily hath.</p>
            <p>Whiſperers and Tale-bearers how welcome are they to a great many for their ſtory's ſake? They procure oftentimes favour to themſelves, while they are breaking the moſt entire Friendſhip. The profaneſt Scoffers, even at Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf, for ſome ſpark of wit in that their greateſt folly are entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commonly by laughter: one corruption or other in hearers cryes up every thing that is ill ſaid, and many things purely for being ill ſaid; and theſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Fools are hardned in their ſin, in that theſe laughing <hi>Fools make a mock of it,</hi> Prov. 14.9. Upon theſe Accounts then it appears no ſmall difficulty to govern the Tongue; the more pains is to be took with it, the ſeverer watch is to be ſet over it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, The Tongue is a very miſchievous <hi>Out-Law,</hi> no Member like it, if it get looſe: what expreſſions has the Apoſtle of it?<note place="margin">Jam. 3.6.</note> 
               <hi>a world of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity</hi> he calls it, knowing by nothing <hi>greater</hi> to ſet it out, and intimating all ſin to be gathered together in it, Uncleanneſs, Injuſtice, Hereſie, Hard-heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, and what not? And yet as if he had not ſaid enough, he adds, that <hi>it defiles the whole Body:</hi> It begins its miſchief at home, like a recoyling Gun that lays its ſhooter in a ſhattered condition on his back, while it wounds his Brother at the heart; one cannot beſpatter his Neighbour but he dirties, and daubs himſelf; the ſin is his, and the ſhame ſhall be his, who ever may at preſent ſuffer by him. Can he charge any further miſchief on the Tongue? <hi>(it ſetteth on fire the courſe of Nature)</hi> all the turbulent motions of theſe low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Spheres, are from the petulancy and inordinacy of this little Member, that laſhes every thing out of its genuine pace; it ſows Jealouſies, it ſtirs up heats and Animoſities, it foments enmities, provokes to Injuries, it ſets all the World together by the ears, that we had better been without Tongues, than that they ſhould be without government. Yet more particularly.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It lets fly at every one, no body is ſecure from it; Majeſty and Innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that are Fences againſt moſt evils, ſet none beyond the reach of the Tongue. The God of Heaven, and the greateſt and Holieſt men on Earth, do often ſuffer by it. We are told of ſome that <hi>ſhould curſe their King and their God.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 8.21. 2 Pet. 2.10.</note> And <hi>are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dignities.</hi> It is a meddleſome Member, that will let no body alone; a very Waſp that is buzzing about in every cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, if its wings be not clipped; another <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> its hands are againſt every one; very extenſive it is then in its Offence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It lets fly every way; in a way of detracting, reviling, ſlattering, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> No Member has ſo many and ſuch contrary ways of offending, that it never lacks opportunity of doing miſchief, be it in good humour or in bad: either by its glozing it deceives us, or by its roving it tires us, or by its levity it deadens us, or by its Ribaldry it daubs us, or by its Inſolency it affronts us.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="508" facs="tcp:95740:261"/>3. No ſuch Wounds as thoſe that are made by it; it hits us e'ne where it liſts, in our Eſtates, in our Lives, in our Names, by falſe witneſs or privy ſlander, it may undo us in all that is dear to us at once, eſpecially in a cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous uncharitable day (as this is): hence you may obſerve that he which bore all the evils of the <hi>World</hi> without any flinching,<note place="margin">Pſal. 69 19, 20</note> is ſomething moved by what he ſuffered from the Tongue, that commonly touches where we be moſt tender, its Darts ſink deepeſt, and its wounds heal ſloweſt of any other; And in this reſpect the Tongue may be expreſſed not only by a <hi>Rod,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 140.3. Pſal. 42.10. Prov. 14 3.</note> by a <hi>Scourge,</hi> by a <hi>Sword,</hi> but by the <hi>ſting and poyſon of a Serpent,</hi> to note the anguiſh of its biting, and the difficulty of its Curing.</p>
            <p>Can we infer nothing from all this? Sure we may conclude,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That in all Reaſon and Righteouſneſs ſuch a Member ſhould be ſtrictly kept in, even as <hi>an Ox that is wont to goring;</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="2">2. That if we keep it not in, God will cut it out; his Righteouſneſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires one, if our Righteouſneſs fail of the other. If our Tongue muſt take its courſe, and go uncontrolled, it ſhall not go unpuniſhed; the firſt ſignal Judgments in the Primitive times were for the ſins of the Tongue. <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira</hi> for their lie are <hi>ſtruck dead,</hi> Acts 5.3. And <hi>Herod</hi> for his vanity and vain-glory in his ſpeech is <hi>eaten up with Worms, while alive,</hi> Acts 12.23. And doth not the ſcorched <hi>Tongue</hi> of the Rich man in Hell <hi>tell</hi> us,<note place="margin">Luke 16.24.</note> that Tongue-ſins ſhall be ſeverely required of us?</p>
            <p n="3">3. That the Tongue when reduced into Order is an Excellent <hi>Subject:</hi> no Member ſo able, ſo Active as that; it is the ſame for good, as it was for evil; when rightly ſet, none is more uſeful or Ornamental to Religion than that. You hear what a value God ſets upon it, the very hearts of others are not to be compared to it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.20. <hi>The Tongue of the Juſt is as choice ſilver: the Heart of the Wicked is little worth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To ſhew particularly what a good <hi>Subject</hi> it is, ſuch as none like it, Note,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is a faithful Intelligencer to God, and to that purpoſe holds a continual correſpondence with him, betraying its boſom Friends that it finds Enemies to him, and diſcovering all plots that are againſt him; not a ſin ſhall ſtir in our own hearts, but God ſhall hear of it, that he may timely ſuppreſs it; not a ſinner ſhall tumultuate in the World, but it ſhall notice him thereof with a ſharp Zeal for his Honour and Intereſt. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.126. <hi>It is time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have made void thy Law.</hi> Pſal. 74, 22, 23. <hi>Ariſe, O Lord, plead thine own Cauſe: remember how the Fooliſh man reproacheth thee daily: forget not the voice of thine Enemies; the tumult of thoſe that riſe up againſt thee increaſeth continually.</hi> This Office advanceth the Tongue unto no ſmall capacity in the Kingdom of God; not that God needs it, but he likes and requires it, and with a communication of like Secrets that concern us he ordinarily requites it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It pays a continual and conſiderable Tribute to him of Praiſe and Thankſgiving; yea, it doth not only pay its own ſhare, but would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly Collect it of others for its great and greatly beloved Prince. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.21. <hi>My mouth ſhall ſpeak the praiſe of the Lord, and let all fleſh bleſs his
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:95740:261"/> holy Name for ever and ever.</hi> Its only grudging is, that it hath ſo ſcanty an Offering, that it can ſpeak no louder, and ſing no ſweeter, when it hath ſuch a Subject as God's praiſes: whence is that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.15. <hi>O Lord open thou my Lips, and my mouth ſhall ſhew forth thy praiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. It buſies it ſelf in bringing in, and reconciling Rebels to him, ſeeks every way the enlargement of his Kingdom by making advantagious reports of him, as in the 5. <hi>Cant.</hi> 10. by beſeeching Perſons to lay aſide their enmity to him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>David</hi> promiſes this Service to God with ſome hopes of ſucceſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.13. <hi>I will teach Tranſgreſſours thy ways, and ſinners ſhall be Converted to thee.</hi> It is needleſs to tell you how Service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able the Tongues of good men have been, and yet are, to this purpoſe: which work, as it is the glory of God, ſo of all works is the joy of Angels, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.10.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is alſo a uſeful <hi>Fellow-Subject;</hi> it hath to give, and is ready to give, good advice and counſel to others, by which it is hugely helpful to them. The Tongue's Charity and Liberality is Famous; and, believe it, when it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a good Tongue, it is, as before noted, <hi>a ſilver Tongue,</hi> and its gifts are beyond thoſe of Silver and Gold. Two expreſſions note to this effect, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.21. <hi>The Lips of the Righteous feed many.</hi> Their words are others Bread, and the beſt Bread they can get. But are they Drink too? See the 10. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11. <hi>The mouth of a Righteous man is a Well of Life;</hi> a Well for plenty, for pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and a Well whoſe Waters have a ſingular Encomium, they are Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Life: to this let me further add what you find, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.18. <hi>The Tongue of the wiſe is health;</hi> whence it may be called, <hi>the wholeſome Tongue,</hi> Prov. 15.4.</p>
            <p>Two Inferences I would hence make.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That it is worth our while, to uſe our utmoſt diligence to bring our Tongues into Order, ſince they are ſuch excellent Organs of God's Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, and ſo eminently ſerviceable unto our Brethren upon their Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That it muſt needs be God's great delight to ſee them in Order, and obſerve them Acting in this their glory; now he loves to hear us ſpeak, accordingly he provokes us to it, as if it yielded ſweet Melody to him. <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.14. <hi>O my Dove, let me hear thy Voice, for thy Voice is ſweet.</hi> Elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where what a high commendation does he give of it? <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.11. <hi>Thy Lips, O my ſpouſe, drop as the Honey-comb, Honey and Milk are under thy Tongue.</hi> But above all we may ſee this in that 3. of <hi>Mal.</hi> 16, 17. where they are repreſented talking, God hearkning, writing and reſolving what he will do for them, and expreſſing what account he made of them; their words ſeemed to hang as <hi>Jewels</hi> in his Ears, and their Perſons he will lay as <hi>Jewels</hi> in his Royal Cloſet, <hi>They ſhall be mine in the day that I make up my Jewels.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That it is the great Glory of a man to have a good government over his Tongue: the bare holding of it in makes a Fool ſeem wiſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.28. <hi>Even a Fool when he holdeth his peace is counted wiſe, and he that ſhutteth his Lips is, eſteemed a man of underſtanding.</hi> And the lolling out of the Tongue both Naturally and Morally is reputed a great indication of Folly,
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:95740:262"/> 
               <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.18. <hi>He that uttereth a ſlander is a Fool.</hi> For what can he propoſe to himſelf in it to compenſate for what he ventures by it? his Brother's Credit is waſted; but his own Conſcience it may be wounded, as having tranſgreſſed both Charity and Equity: and two to one, if in the like or a worſe kind he be not requited, and go unpitied: Yea, ſhould all others ſpare him, he is even with himſelf; for whatever he hath ſaid of his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, he hath ſcarce given him a worſe Name, than he has took to himſelf of a ſlanderer.</p>
            <p>But the right ordering of our Tongue, as to what is let out, and what is kept in, does not only ſpeak a good man, but makes him glorious and eminent among other good men. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>If any man offend not in word, the ſame is a perfect man, and able to bridle the whole Body;</hi> he muſt have a meaſure of his own parts, a command of his paſſions, and in-ſight into Seaſons and Occaſions. It is a modeſt expreſſion, that he which can do this is able to command himſelf: indeed if we could find the man he is fit to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the World.</p>
            <p>Whereas on the other hand he is fit for nothing that has a looſe and licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Tongue; and it is generally a token of an impotent man. Try what you can make of him, an ill Neighbour I will warrant you he will prove; he muſt be pratling of every thing, and every one; every thing he ſees, every thing he hears, he turns into a ſtory: one would not he ſhould look over ones Wall, come into ones Houſe, talk with ones Children or Servants; he is either fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of them, or dropping into them what is not convenient. His Eye, his Ear are ſtill progging for fewel to that fire his Tongue is enflamed with. His humour is ſet out, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.6. <hi>If he come to ſee me he ſpeaketh Vanity, h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s heart gathereth Iniquity to it ſelf, when he goeth abroad he telleth it.</hi> As bad a Neighbour as he is, he is yet a worſe Friend; he trifles away our time, he tires our patience, he betrays our truſts; there can be no confidence in him, we muſt ſtill be upon the Watch, one may as well make a whole Town our Friend as ſuch a one. But yet too a much worſe Relation he makes,
'tis next dwelling in a Mill, to dwell with him; his clack is always going, only not in ſo good tune and order as that we allude to; the wiſe man could not think of a Condition ſo intolerable, as the being yoked with ſuch a Relation. <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.24. <hi>It is better to dwell in the Corner of an Houſe-top, than with a brawling Woman and in a wide Houſe.</hi> And a brawling man is as very a trouble-houſe, and in ſome ſenſe more intolerable, as more praeter-natural. In ſum, a well governed Tongue is not more our glory, than an unruly one is our ſhame; that we are pricked on both ſides by Honour and diſhonour, to endeavour as much as may be the regulation of this Member, as we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult the Credit of our whole man. Theſe things that we in general have promiſed may be improved as motives, and moral helps for the government of the Tongue. But more particularly, in order to its right management we muſt conſider, <list>
                  <item>1. Its juſt meaſure.</item>
                  <item>2. Its due matter.</item>
                  <item>3. Its proper ſcope.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="511" facs="tcp:95740:262"/>1. As to the meaſure; and here we muſt note the extremes that are to be avoided, and the mean that is to be obſerved.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt extreme is over-ſilence; a rare fault, but a fault againſt the very intent of the Tongue, and is a burying of that Talent; it is juſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable with a great deal of evil, and ſuſpitious of much more. And this in ſome is natural from frigidity, and exceſſive melancholy; they are the eaſieſt pardoned, though not altogether excuſed, when otherwiſe duly qualified and called, <hi>Exod.</hi> 4.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p>In ſome this is contracted by others iniquity: theſe are moſt to be pityed, the violent ſuffocation of their thoughts is not without great vexation of their hearts: as <hi>Lot</hi> might be an inſtance, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2, 8. And <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 39.23. <hi>I was dumb with ſilence, I held my peace even from good, and my ſorrow was ſtirred, my heart was but within me, while I muſed the fire burnt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In others this is affected out of <hi>Moroſeneſs,</hi> doggedneſs, or deſign, in theſe the offence is moſt aggravated, the ſilence is moſt ſinful: but more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly.</p>
            <p>When are we guilty of over-much ſilence?</p>
            <p n="1">1. When Juſtice is obſtructed by it: my Neighbour has ſuffered wrong, I know it, without my teſtimony he cannot have right, I conceal it, my ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy involves me in the iniquity, <hi>Lev.</hi> 5.1. A pretence of peaceableneſs and good Neighbour-hood ſtops the mouths of ſeveral in this caſe; but peace of Conſcience, and the cauſe of Righteouſneſs, ſhould be preferred before all peace, and above every other conſideration take place, if the matter eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally be momentous.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When Charity is omitted, and is not like from other hands to be at leaſt ſo ſeaſonably, and advantagiouſly adminiſtred, there is oft-times great Charity in a word, and it is the greateſt cruelty imaginable to ſpare that word, and it is often further heightned from the parties to which it is grudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For inſtance, if we are made privy to any thing, the diſcovery of which is for great publique good, and conceal it for private advantage, beyond what is fitting for our private capacity, and a juſt reward for our ingenuity; we highly tranſgreſs againſt publique Charity, and are unworthy of the benefits of Society: this we learn from the Lepers caſe, themſelves being Judges, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 7.8, 9. Again, if we alone are privy to a Brother or Friend's fault, wherein he goes on, and is not like of himſelf to come off, bolſtering him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in the opinion of its ſecrecy, a word of reproof from thee might ſave him, and thou art the greateſt Enemy he has, if thou with-holdeſt it from him, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17.</p>
            <p>Further, thy own Soul is in a dark and diſmal ſtate, thy Neighbour or Friend is full of light, by one queſtion thou mighteſt do much to thy own il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumination, and yet thou pineſt away and periſheſt for lack of knowledg, where is thy love to thy ſelf in the mean time? Tongue-Charity is the cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of all Charity, and yet many, certainly not without great guilt, let their Countreys, Friends, and own Souls ſtarve for lack of it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If our own Spirits be ſoured by it, words kept in are many times like humours ſtruck in, go to the heart and offend the vital parts. Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs, cenſoriouſneſs, are often ſo fed; vent might give relief in this
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:95740:263"/> caſe, and be the only means for our Cure, if moderately and diſcreetly given. Many can write their <hi>probatum eſt</hi> to this.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If our Company, whom we may and ought to pleaſe ſo far as we can, be grieved or offended at it. <hi>Silence,</hi> where we may be free, and have wont to be free, and it is juſtly expected we ſhould be free, as among Friends, Relations, <hi>&amp;c. Speaks</hi> very cuttingly, and ſhould not cauſleſly be long kept, leſt it be ill interpreted; it intimates anger at them, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of them, it renders you wholly inſignificant to them, you had as good ſend your Horſe among them, if you will not converſe like a man with them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. If our Calling and Commiſſion from God be to ſpeak, we may not be ſilent, as to any one thing committed to us to ſpeak, in this caſe. You know who ſaid,<note place="margin">Acts 4.20:</note> 
               <hi>We cannot but ſpeak, woe is us if we do not; Paul</hi> no other way could clear himſelf of their blood, than by proteſting <hi>that he had not ſhunned to declare unto them the whole counſel of God,</hi> Acts 20.27. And our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our doth mainly comfort himſelf, as having hid or kept back nothing given in charge to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.9, 10, 11. <hi>Loe, I have not refrained my Lips, O Lord, thou knoweſt. I have not hid thy Righteouſneſs within my heart, I have not concealed thy loving kindneſs, and thy truth; with-hold not thou thy tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies from me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. If the Cauſe and Honour of God call for a publique teſtimony, no one in his way may innocently with-hold it, however mean be his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city; Children therefore in Chriſt's day were called forth to it, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 21.15, 16. And when offence was took on a like occaſion, he tells them, <hi>that if thoſe ſhould hold their peace, the ſtones would immediately cry out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 3.7.</note>You ſee then that there is a <hi>time to ſpeak as well as keep ſilence:</hi> happy he that hits his time, and he that heeds it will hardly miſs it, or if he does, ſhall the more eaſily be excuſed it. We commonly ſay that little ſaid is ſoon amended: true, but yet for not ſpeaking as well as not doing in ſome caſes we may be condemned. It is therefore our duty to rouze our Tongue when it is ſluggiſh, as well as hold it in where it is laviſh, calling upon it as he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 57.8. <hi>Awake up my Glory;</hi> or as you have another in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Judges</hi> 5.12. <hi>Awake, Awake, Deborah, Awake, Awake, utter a Song.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond extreme to be avoided is Loquacity, or over-much ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a fault many are incident to, through the levity of their temper, and looſeneſs of their Tongues, and it is a very hard task for them to talk much and talk well. He is peremptory, <hi>Prov.</hi> 10.19. <hi>that in the multitude of words there wants not ſin.</hi> And I ſuppoſe he ſpeaks modeſtly, and that he means, that there is a great deal of ſin.</p>
            <p>But let our Query be</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
               </label> When any one may be ſaid to talk too much?</p>
            <p>Some few of many inſtances take as follows.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When talking excludes thinking, the Tongue out-runs the wit: a little of this talk is too much, as being to no purpoſe but to betray our fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, abuſe our Brother's patience, and waſte precious time. One may talk
<pb n="513" facs="tcp:95740:263"/> to Children at this rate to ſave a needleſs expence of ſenſe, where there is but little; but it is an intolerable preſumption upon men, to entertain them with words morecrude than our belches, that we fetch not ſo low as our breath, and that little differ from an Aſſe's braying.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When it will not give way to hearing, eſpecially when wiſer and better men be preſent. If they were inferior and weaker, it were meet they ſhould be allowed their turns; every one may be ſuppoſed to have brought ſomething wherewith the whole might be edified: in ingroſſing all the talk to thy ſelf, thou art chargeable with unſeemly vaunting, thou art in the ready way to emptying, there is no hope of thy repleniſhing; go hoop and hallow in the Woods, if thou wilt be anſwered only by thy own Eccho. Proud men and paſſionate men are apt ſo to offend, they have no ears, and ſo are unlike to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie, and for any thing they are like to get, had as good keep out of Company. Mark advice of one that underſtood the government of the Tongue as well as any other, <hi>James</hi> 1.19. <hi>Let every man be ſwift to hear, ſlow to ſpeak, ſlow to wrath.</hi> The laſt direction is to make good the former.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When talking ſhuts out working either in our common or Chriſtian Calling. Some men have got ſuch a vein of talking, that it is their great bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and for which they neglect all buſineſs, ſo many hours in a day they ſnatch from all occaſions on purpoſe to chat, this is more than can be juſtified; the Apoſtle blames it in the Women of his day, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.13. <hi>They learn to be idle, wandring about from Houſe to Houſe, and not only idle, but tattlers alſo, and buſie-bodies, ſpeaking things they ought not.</hi> And ſure it is more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved; in men, that ſhould be more ſtayed, and might be much better im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed; but the Tongue is not only wont to take the <hi>hands</hi> off of buſineſs, but to take upon it the buſineſs of the <hi>hands,</hi> as in the great duty of diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the poor, <hi>that</hi> will ſerve them with good words, when the hands ſhould be miniſtring good things, the vanity of which he upbraids, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.15, 16. And ſo it is apt to run all Religious Offices into mere talk, which is like grain that hath only a ſtalk.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the whole man is turned into Tongue, that ſure is a talkative man. And ſuch there be a great many, that cannot utter half their mind the Natural way, whether it be from the fulneſs of filthineſs of the matter they are ſtuffed with you may gueſs; I am apt to think that they are full of filthy matter, that the Tongue is e'ne aſhamed to utter; or elſe ſtraitned to vent faſt enough, and therefore hands, and feet and eyes, muſt ſpeak too for greater riddance; they talk in Characters for haſt, ſometimes you have ſigns for words, at other times words for Sentences, you muſt gueſs their meaning: for inſtance, He is — I'le ſay no more — that is their way to brand a man, leaving you to think the worſt you can, and at leiſure to put it in, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving hereby a Liberty for themſelves to creep out if called in Queſtion. This is the greateſt talker I know, he <hi>ſpeaks</hi> when he <hi>ſays nothing,</hi> and ſays moſt when he utters: leaſt <hi>Hunc tu Romane caveto,</hi> look to this man, I durſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt warrant him a filthy beaſt, or crafty knave, though it may be he only counterfeits one—the wiſe man doth ſo repreſent him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.12, 13, 14. He walketh with his mouth, and talketh with his Feet; what a Monſter is this Man?</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="514" facs="tcp:95740:264"/>3. The mean that lyes between theſe two extremes is, neither to wrap this Talent up in a Napkin, nor yet laviſh it away; but prudently to uſe it as we ſee opportunity to improve it, that in the latter day we may give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Rules.</note>In order to the obſervance of which mean I would give the following Directions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Reſt not in Ignorance; that will ſeal up thy mouth in ſilence if thou beeſt ſenſible of it, or let looſe thy Tongue with impudence if thou over-lookeſt it. Open thy Eyes, open thy Ears, open thy Heart to receive inſtruction, that thou maiſt be fit for pertinent communication; lay in before thou layeſt out; and particularly know thy ſelf, know whereof thou art about to ſpeak, to whom thou doſt ſpeak, and thou ſhalt not be to ſeek how to ſpeak, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any thing or nothing, whether much or little, whether interrogatively or dogmatically; the knowledg of thy own meaſure will be a great help to keep the right meaſure in this whole matter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Give not way to idleneſs: imploy thy heart, imploy thy hands, charge every part with ſomething, and then this buſie Member may ſubmit to its ſhare, and go to its burthen; but if the whole man be diſ-engaged, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imployed, all the vigor of the man doth ordinarily run to his Tongue, he muſt be doing ſomething though next to nothing, and falls commonly into a humour of exceſſive talking, as you may obſerve in Children that are not come to work, and old people that are paſt it, unleſs Grace or gravity of manners check it. The <hi>Athenians</hi> were this way tainted, that nothing but News would be diſgeſted, and in gathering and ſpreading that, they were perpetually Exerciſed, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.21. But buſineſs diverts and ſpends the humour, and ſomething tames and moderates this as well as other Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Avoid Drunkenneſs; that looſens the Reins of the whole man, and eſpecially prevents the Government of the Tongue, and ſets it on running and rambling without fear or wit. It makes men ſpew that were wont only to ſpit, it brings up all that is in our minds as well as ſtomacks: <hi>In vino ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritas,</hi> all will out when the Wine is in, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.13. Perſons of an airy light temper may find this inconvenience forthwith, upon a ſip or two of Wine or ſtrong Drink, and for every glaſs of Liquor abate an Ounce of wit; they ſhould be more cautious than other men. Wine is indeed proper for them of a ſorrowful heart, to raiſe their dejected Spirits to a due temper; but one that for ordinary is rather touched with too much levity, is quickly over-born with it, and his Tongue ſoon trips, however firm his Feet may ſtand.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Watch againſt all paſſionateneſs; that is a degree of madneſs, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitates wiſe men into great Extravagancies of Speech; many can ſcarce hold their hands, but fewer can hold their Tongues under the tranſport of it. If ever the teeth are uſeful to bite in the Tongue, it is when it is enflamed by Paſſion, and has broke in heat from the Government of Reaſon; either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frain Anger, or refrain ſpeech altogether when angry, as you would not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim your own Folly.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="515" facs="tcp:95740:264"/>5. Keep under Pride, that never keeps a decorum, but puts you forward beyond what becomes you, in contempt of others that are not Inferiors to you; whereas Humility will repreſent them at leaſt even with you, that you would be awed into a graceful modeſty. If we think we have all the wit, we ſhall next arrogate to our ſelves all the talk, and by thinking our ſelves wiſe make our ſelves Fools.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Keep up Charity, which will ſecure from the tranſports of ill will and Envy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The matter of our Diſcourſe is to be regulated: and here occurs a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold conſideration of it.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Something it is our ſin to make matter of our Diſcourſe.</item>
               <item>2. Other things it is our Duty.</item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. As to ſinful matter, we muſt wholly reſtrain our Tongues; <hi>Let no corrupt Communication proceed out of your mouths:</hi> and again, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.13. <hi>Keep thy Tongue from evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The particular evils of the Tongue are not to be reckoned up in a ſingle Sermon.</p>
            <p>Some general Rules I will therefore lay down, whereto the moſt conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable may be reduced.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe things are evil, and not to be uttered, whereby God imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately is diſhonoured: And by this we are admoniſhed to take heed of venting Hereſies, uttering Blaſphemies, all raſh Swearing, forſwearing, and taking God's Name in vain; Sins all of an high Nature, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted generally in height of Spirit, and look as like preſumptuous ſins, for which God hath appointed no Sacrifice, as moſt we can reckon up, in regard of the ſmall temptation to them,<note place="margin">Numb. 15.30, 31.</note> and the impudence that is common in them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe things alſo our Tongue is to be reſtrained from, whereby our Brother is wronged as to his outward man, whether as to Life, Eſtate, or Name: unrighteouſneſs is the evil of ſuch Speeches, a manifeſt evil, and is aggravated from the degree wherein he ſuffers, and from the directneſs of our intention in bringing it upon him; though whether directly, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, of malice and ſet purpoſe, or out of pure weakneſs, our Brother ſuffers and we ſin, that we were no more tender of him in concerns that are ſo dear to our ſelves, and about which we have been ſo ſpecially cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned of God: and of this Nature eminently are ſlander and falſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thoſe things muſt more eſpecially be forborn, whereby our Brother's Soul is like to be defiled, and his manners corrupted, in that the greateſt Charity is here tranſgreſſed. As for inſtance, all unclean Speeches, by which Luſt may be drawn forth; provoking Speeches, whereby paſſion may be ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red up; all enticements to evil, and encouragements in evil; any thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by our Brother's ſpirit may be lightned, or his heart hardned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Such things whereby the fundamental Laws of Society are violated, and all confidence in one another deſtroyed; I will inſtance particularly in three.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="516" facs="tcp:95740:265"/>1. Lying, that makes words ſignifie juſt nothing, and cuts off all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion between one anothers Souls, that we can never know each others minds: we are hereby at a far greater loſs than if we could not ſpeak at all. How deteſtable this ſin is you may learn by what you read, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.8. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.15.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Tale-bearing, that is a Trade ſet up directly againſt all Friendſhip, and the great bane of Love in the World; which yet has too much countenance from the generality of the World: but God that is always more than our ſelves ſolicitous for our good, has eſpecially cautioned againſt it, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.16. and warned us of the evil effects of it, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.8.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Revealing of Secrets, which deſtroys all confidence, and breaks the moſt ſacred Bonds of Friendſhip. And as to theſe we may be doubly faulty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reference to ſuch Secrets as are committed to us <hi>ſub ſigillo:</hi> theſe every one is convinced he ought to keep ſo for his truths ſake, and to anſwer the confidence that was put in him; though many are never quiet till they have broke this Bond, but are rather irritated by their being bound. <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.13. <hi>A Tale-bearer revealeth Secrets.</hi> Eſpecially,</p>
            <p n="2">2. In reference to ſuch as come to us without ſuch a formal Bond, out of weakneſs or good nature; if there may be wrong to the party confiding in us by divulging what he hath ſo committed to us, the very matter of the caſe obligeth us, in juſtice, though not in faithfulneſs, we are bound to be his Secretaries, if a far greater good may not come by the diſcovery. And let me here give a ſpecial caution in a caſe wherein you may be lyable to Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</p>
            <p>Take heed what you do tell to a Friend, leſt he ſhould after prove an Enemy; this is prudence. Take heed you diſcover not, when an Enemy, what was told you as a Friend; that is Piety.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The matter of the Diſcourſe is faulty, when the very ends of it are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlooked, and you fruitleſly and fooliſhly ſquander away both time and Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents, not conſidering that <hi>idle</hi> words are alſo <hi>evil</hi> words, and to be reckoned for another day, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12, 36, 37.</p>

                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
               </label> How ſhall we reſtrain our Tongues from all this evil?</p>
            <p n="1">1. By purging the Seeds of it out of our hearts. Our Saviour looked upon it as an unnatural thing, and not to be expected, that they that are evil ſhould ſpeak good things, in as much <hi>as out of the abundance of the heart the mouth ſpeaketh,</hi> Mat. 12.34. That therefore muſt be firſt cleanſed, that the mouth may be kept clean; while there are filthy thoughts, malicious purpoſes, impetuous paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and idle imaginations allowed there, by the Tongue as well as other ways they will have their vent: by every Member the heart will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging it ſelf of it's abundance; whence again he obſerves, <hi>that out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, thefts, falſe-witneſs, blaſphemies,</hi> Mat. 15.19. Mind therefore how you are ſtill directed to lay the Ax unto the Root, and crucifie the evil affections of the <hi>heart,</hi> that you may prevent the Extravagancies of the <hi>Tongue,</hi> Eph. 4.31. <hi>Let all Bitterneſs, and Wrath, and Anger, and Clamour, and evil ſpeaking be put away from you with all malice;</hi> he deſpaired <hi>Clamour and evil ſpeaking</hi> ſhould be reſtrained, except <hi>Wrath and Malice</hi> were extirpated. And to the ſame purpoſe <hi>Col.</hi> 3.8 9. <hi>Put off Anger,
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:95740:265"/> Wrath, Malice, and then</hi> he hath ſome hopes, they might alſo forbear <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemy, filthy Communication, Lying.</hi> Let your firſt care then be of the Heart, and it's firſt Motions, for every Member thence hath it's impreſſions and all pretence of care without a regard to this Will be but a palliation, and we may expect a more violent Eruption.</p>
            <p n="2">2. By ſtopping our Ears, and ſhutting our Eyes againſt every thing that may feed the fore-mentioned evil humours; if they be fermented afreſh, they will flow anew, and be aware of remainders of them in the beſt of you: If we would effectually keep a fire from ſmoaking, we muſt keep it from burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to ſecure it from burning, keep it from blowing and freſh ſupplies of fewel. We can eaſily apply this, no refining of the Tongue without purging of the Heart, no keeping that pure, if any thing that defiles is ſuffered to enter there, the ordinary paſſages into which are by the Eye and Ear; avoid therefore in proſecution of this Direction, all vain, idle, angry, envious, malicious Companions, leſt they be infuſing into thee their Venom. Bid adieu to all Profane Ranters and Ribalds, to all Tale-bearers and Whiſperers; they will kindle the fire of Luſt or Anger, if there be a ſpark in thee. And next to them, avoid all Books that are ſtuffed with profane Jeſts, or that gender to exceſſive heats; theſe aſſault us like formed Armies, when occaſional words are like ſlight Sallies of a ſmall party. And laſtly, beware of vain and filthy ſights, and the more artificial, the more danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, as more affecting the fancy, ſinking deeper into the memory, and preſſing more importunately into the mouth, they tickle us into the talk of them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. By laying the Laws againſt all idle and evil ſpeaking before our eyes, in their reaſonableneſs and rigor: their reaſonableneſs will appear, if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them <hi>as for us;</hi> would we any body ſhould abuſe <hi>us</hi> with lyes? or load <hi>us</hi> with reproaches? no; why then it is well God hath provided by his Law that they ſhall not; and is it not alike equal, thou ſhouldeſt not deal by another, as thou wouldeſt not be dealt by thy ſelf? The Law then is good, and the puniſhment is as great. Thy Soul may go for an ill word: conſider of it, has an evil word ſufficient pleaſure to compenſate for eternal pain? Sure it is wiſdom to forbear ſuch words, if we may pay ſo dear for them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By conſidering the odiouſneſs of it in others, and in them we may ſee it in its true colours; things are too near us to be aright diſcerned by us, when they are obſerved in our ſelves. A Lyar, a Falſe-witneſs, a Back-bit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r, a Tale-bearer, how do you like ſuch men? Would you have your Child trained up in ſuch things? Why then will you allow them in your ſelves? How came they to be more tolerable in you than other men? Is it that it is no matter what becomes of you? How comes it that you have caſt off all care of and love to ſelf, that you would have every body better than your ſelf?</p>
            <p n="5">5. By reflecting upon the reproaches we have had from our own hearts for it, and the inconveniencies we have ſuffered, and the dammages others have reaped by it, beyond our poſſible reparation; is it not time then to take up?</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="518" facs="tcp:95740:266"/>6. By remembring that God obſerves it, and will Judg thee for it. A Reverend man would awe thee, if there was danger, eſpecially of the Pillory; and how canſt thou caſt off the fear of God, to talk before him ſo looſely? How wilt thou like to have all thy vain and vile words read and aggravated at the laſt day? It will be one part of that dayes work, <hi>Jude</hi> 15, 16.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is matter that it is our Duty to Diſcourſe of, the general Nature of which I ſhall lay before you; as,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Such, as though of a common and inferior Nature, as referring to things of this Life; yet is of conſequence to our ſelves or Neighbours to be debated, for the right underſtanding or better managing of our joynt, or ſeveral concerns: this as tending to Juſtice, Charity, Peace, or the like, by the good uſe it may be of, is Sanctified and becomes our duty, and we may not without ſin decline it, when duly provoked to it; for, as mean as theſe matters ſeem, God hath concerned himſelf to make ſevere Laws, that we worſt not one another in them, by which we are obliged to improve, and imbetter each other as we can, and ſurely moſt of all when by a word it may be done. How does <hi>Job</hi>'s Conſcience approve him in his having been a faithful Counſellor? <hi>Job</hi> 19.15. <hi>I was eyes to the Blind.</hi> And what a Character does Chriſt give to the Peace-makers? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. <hi>They ſhall be called the Children of God.</hi> And yet further, the command to Worldly buſineſs ſix dayes in ſeven does more than allow Worldly Diſcourſe, eſpecially when it hath a moral uſe. So that as it is a vain Superſtition of ſome not to touch theſe things, ſo is it of others to decline neceſſary pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable talk of them, as if it were a piece of Service to God to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs unto men, while by his providence we are among them. Know then, where by weakneſs your Brother needs advice, and by a greater ſtock of wiſdom you are able to give it, it is his duty in order to the prudent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement even of his Worldly affairs to ask it, and yours as freely to give it for you therefore; have it, and cannot otherwiſe give a good account of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Caution.</note>Let me only caution, that on this pretence you Lanch not out into Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of this Nature</p>
            <p>Unſeaſonably, as on the Lord's Day; unneceſſarily for mere talk's ſake; immoderately, to the burying of all other Diſcourſe, or hindering more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant buſineſs of your own or Brother's: it would alſo be carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that we intrude not our ſelves as buſie-bodies into the Diſcourſe of others matters, while we are unconcerned, and to Perſons unconcerned, for which we are like to go unthanked, whereby our Brother may be wronged, and no body is edified.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may be our duty to Diſcourſe of what is done in the World, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in God's Juſtice, Power, Wiſdom, Faithfulneſs or Goodneſs is advanced; One deſign of God's marvellous working is to furniſh us with fit matter for talking. His Signs in <hi>Egypt</hi> are particularly noted to have had this reference, <hi>That they might tell in the Ears of their Sons, and Sons Sons, what things he had wrought in</hi> Egypt, <hi>that they might know that he was the Lord,</hi> Exod. 10.2. God's works are one of his Books, that we ſhould much confer
<pb n="519" facs="tcp:95740:266"/> about. <hi>David</hi> pleaſes himſelf to ſee the whole World as ſet about a round Table, conferring their Notes of what they had ſeen and obſerved of God in his works from Generation to Generation. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 145.5, 6. <hi>I will ſpeak of the glorious Honour of thy Majeſty, and of thy wondrous works, and men ſhall ſpeak of the might of thy terrible Acts, and I will declare thy greatneſs, they ſhall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This ſeems to be talk for the Generality of men, there is ſomething in it peculiarly pleaſing to all palats, and an Example often affects, when a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept would be over-looked; and I am confident, if we could prudently Diſcourſe of the works of God, we might more advantage the profaner ſort of men, than by talking to them out of the Word; for they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt that, and ſhut upon it ſtreight, as perceiving whereto that would, but they are pleaſed with ſtory, and lye more open to it, that there is greater hope e're they be aware of their being caught with it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.42. That this Diſcourſe may be profitable, take the following ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Make wiſe Obſervation, look with both Eyes on what happens, look into it, look after God in it, and ſpy what Attribute is eminently glorified by it. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107.43. <hi>Whoſo is wiſe and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Make faithful repreſentations, lye not for God. The <hi>Romiſh</hi> Legends by their multitude of Fables have greatly miniſhed the veneration of all Miracles. One fly ſpoils a whole pot of Oyntment: the ſame does one lye in a moſt uſeful Hiſtory.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Make Charitable Interpretations, as to perſons or parties, be not too ſevere in cenſuring them that God makes Examples. It was the fault and folly of the Jews. Chriſt tells us, they were out: and we as well as they may be out; let us be warned by them, <hi>Luke</hi> 13.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And make pious applications, and ſtill put in your ſelf as concerned where you note any thing to be learned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.5, 11. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.11, 12. Many profane the Providences of God by their ſlight Diſcourſes of them, without regard to God or his Glory in them; but you on the other hand by obſerving Rules, may hallow his Name and ſpread his fame.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is yet more eſpecially our duty to be Diſcourſing to one another of what God hath ſaid to the World for our mutual Direction, Caution, and Conſolation; this is to be our familiar and frequent Diſcourſe, wherein we ſhould be moſt delighted, and whereby we may be moſt edified. <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.6, 7. <hi>Theſe words, which I command thee this day, ſhall be in thine heart, and thou ſhalt teach them diligently unto thy Children, and ſhalt talk of them when thou ſitteſt in thine Houſe, and when thou walkeſt by the way, and when thou lyeſt down, and when thou riſeſt up.</hi> Col. 3.16. <hi>Let the Word of Chriſt dwell in you richly in all wiſdom, teaching and admoniſhing one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What will we adviſe in Order to the more eaſie and profitable manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this Duty?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Furniſh your ſelves with all variety of pious matter, that you may have a word to adapt every occaſion, and bring out of your Treaſure new or old according to the Seaſon; hence you will have a preſentneſs of mind
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:95740:267"/> to the work, and there will be a peculiar gratefulneſs in your words, as ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring neither of force or affect<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tion: in this ſenſe Chriſt had the <hi>Tongue of the Learned,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 13.52.</note> and thus he would have <hi>every Scribe inſtructed:</hi> this would make our Diſcourſe ſtill pertinent, that it could not well be rejected, <hi>Prov.</hi> 25.11. a word upon the <hi>wheels</hi> he calls it,<note place="margin">Iſa. 50.40.</note> in reſpect of readineſs and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Affect your heart with what you are about to ſpeak. <hi>David</hi> waited till his heart was hot, and the fire burned, and then he ſpake, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.3. And then it is that your words will ſlow from your mouths, and glow upon your Companions hearts, you ſeem in carneſt, and they know not how to take it in j<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Fortifie your ſelves for ſuch Diſcourſe, reckoning you may meet with diſcouragements; but put on the brow of braſs, be not diſmayed nor aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: let iniquity be aſhamed and ſtop its mouth; but while vanity and all manner of Ribaldry paſſes currant in every Company, let not good Diſcourſe creep into a corner, as if it alone were guilty. Say as <hi>Paul, I am not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of the Goſpel of Chriſt,</hi> and reſolve to walk and talk according to it, ſay the World what they will of thee for it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Watch occaſions to fall moſt handſomly upon it; not as putting by Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of a lower allay, but as improving it, ingraffing your good Fruit on their Crab-ſtock, as Chriſt hath given you frequent Examples; and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure your ſelves the more Natural and inſenſible your tranſition is, the eaſier and better will the Diſcourſe be entertained, in as much as the Company is leſs affronted, than if their Diſcourſe was directly put by, and yours preferred.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Labour to make your good Diſcourſe every way as grateful as it may, wiſely conſidering perſons you are converſing with, what is to be ſaid, and how every thing may take beſt that you ſay: <hi>becauſe the Preacher was wiſe he ſought out acceptable,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Eccl. 2.10.</note> as well as profitable <hi>words;</hi> and no doubt <hi>acceptable,</hi> that they might be <hi>profitable.</hi> Now there are ſeveral things give a grace, and are a great ſet off to our words, ſome of which commend them to one, and ſome to others, and ſome to all.</p>
            <p>To begin with thoſe that are more general and adorn all Diſcourſe: ſuch are meaſure, ſeaſon, ſuitableneſs, ſweetneſs, foundneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Theſe muſt be ſtill regarded, or Company may juſtly be offended, as being ſome way abuſed, their time ſeems not valued, their buſineſſes regarded, their paſſions conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, their Perſons or parts duly reverenced, when their Ears are imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently entertained, or perpetually with the ſame things tired.</p>
            <p>And then more particularly, modeſty wins much on Superiors, familiarity on Inferiors, a pleaſant Lepor or Saltneſs upon Equals, freeneſs on Friends, Courteouſneſs on Strangers, meekneſs on Offenders, plainneſs on the Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. You need take leaſt care to pleaſe the wiſe, for he heeds the matter, and can make allowances for the manner of the Diſcourſe.</p>

               </gap>ſting or facetious expreſſing our ſelves, condemned here by the Apoſtle, is noted, is of a good ſignification, and was of good Reputation among the ſobereſt Heathen, and imported, as they deemed, one of the great vertues, or graces of Speech, as ſhewing readineſs of wit, and ſweetneſs of manners, in which Original ſenſe, <hi>Calvin</hi> ſays of it, that it is worthy of <hi>a Free and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. It is as generally ſuppoſed, that this Lepor or Saltneſs of Speech was ordinarily abuſed, and under pretence of wit moſt men played the Fools, venting the <hi>froth</hi> inſtead of the <hi>Flower</hi> of their brains, which the Apoſtle is thought to have reſpected in joyning together <hi>jeſting and fooliſh talking;</hi> And you know that a Jeſter and a Fool are even Synonymous terms among us, none more idly ſquandring away their wit, without reſpect to thoſe chief ends, for which God gave it, and they are obliged to uſe it, minding only the tickling of the fleſh, having no regard to the profiting of the Spirit. This abuſe of wit, that was even become general, I conceive the Apoſtle lets fly at, as alſo they apprehended, that Tranſlated the word by ſcurrility, into which this Lepor was degenerated. Now our wit may be recko<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed to be abuſed,</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we are conceited of it, and uſe it purely in Oſtentation of ſelf, and contempt of others; hereby we are injurious to our own Souls, nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pride, which it ſhould be our great buſineſs to pluck down.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we are immoderate in it, and either vainly or extravagantly la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh it. Wit ſhould be uſed like Salt, ſparingly: a grain or two does well, a meal ſurfeits. It ſpeaks vanity in us, and nouriſhes over-much levity in others, and two to one we run dregs, if we know not when to have done, medling with every thing and every one.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When we are offenſive by it, either to God's holy Ears by our Profane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or to our Brother's by over-ſharpneſs; and we ſhould be eſpecially ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, where there is more than ordinary weakneſs, or plainneſs; and a greater Liberty may be uſed in this latter kind, where there is great wickedneſs or conceitedneſs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When to any baſe ends we proſtitute it: as firſt, to expoſe holy things or Perſons to the ſcorn of Fools, leſſning their repute and reverence by our light mentioning of them, or playing upon them, this is a degree of Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; or, Secondly, when we deſign it only to make ſport and raiſe Laughter, among thoſe eſpecially which we ſhould rather provoke to weeping. From all this it appears that there needs great Caution in the uſe of this gift or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, But yet that it may be both innocently, and advantagiouſly uſed, and Chriſtian gravity maintained, I ſhall briefly prove from Scripture Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, even in moſt ſerious and weighty matters. And I note eminently three occaſions, where there may ſeem needful ſome more than ordinary ſtrain of Speech, or uſe of Salt in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If what we ſay be for <hi>Food</hi> or Phyſick to a <hi>Sick</hi> or weak ſtomacked Perſon, that may otherwiſe nauſeate it, this Salt may be uſeful to give it a reliſh, and get it the eaſier down: for which purpoſe the plain way of
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:95740:268"/> ſpeaking was waved by <hi>Nathan,</hi> 2 Sam. 12.1, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And again, by another Prophet, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 20.38, &amp;c. And almoſt generally by our Saviour: with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a <hi>Parable he ſcarce ſpake any thing;</hi> there was no coming upon thoſe kind of Perſons, without circumventing of them. On the like neceſſity we ſhould endeavour to ſhew like ingenuity, that we may catch Perſons with guile, that will not otherwiſe come to hand.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If our words be intended for <hi>Swords,</hi> this kind of Speech doth ſet a keenneſs upon them, for which purpoſe it is moſt frequently uſed in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as you may ſee notable inſtances, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.27. 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.32, 33. The proud Fool will not be convinced often by plain Reaſon, that there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt a neceſſity of irriſion; we muſt make him ridiculous that his Folly may be conſpicuous, when he is throughly expoſed, he may chance be humbled. I take the wiſe man, as directing us to this method with this ſort of men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 26.5. <hi>Anſwer a Fool according to his Folly, leſt he be wiſe in his own Conceit;</hi> according to his Folly, that is, according as his Folly does de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, anſwer him ſharply, ſmartly, utterly ſilence him, that he may take care to ſpeak wiſer another time, <hi>(repone illi verbera &amp; virgam)</hi> as one ſays, anſwer him with words as ſmart as Rods, <hi>the Fool's back requires them,</hi> Prov. 26.3.</p>
            <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">Eccl. 12.11.</note> If as <hi>Nails</hi> we would drive our words (to which alſo they are compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red) there is a tendency in this pleaſantneſs of Speech to faſten them, and fix them more firmly in the memory; whence I conceive old dying <hi>Jacob</hi> gave his laſt Bleſſing in ſuch harmonious words, as ſome of them are bearing allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to his Sons names, ſuch as <hi>Jehudah, Jodudah; Dan, Jadin; Gad, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dud,</hi> &amp;c. The Mothers impoſed their names for one Reaſon, but ſomething in their future condition the Father ſees that agrees well enough to their names, whereon he chooſeth to read their deſtinies as it were by them, for the more eaſie remembrance of them. I would not theſe Examples ſhould be abuſed, to prevent which let me only caution,</p>
            <p>That we gravely, ſparingly, and for like neceſſary ends, do imitate them; or pretend no Patronage from them. To proceed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Naturalize this Diſcourſe if poſſible, and as far as poſſible to you; then, and not till then you will ſpeak with eaſe, and ſpeak with a grace, and this facility is chiefly got by frequency. We muſt in a manner con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine our ſelves to this dialect, that we may get this Excellency in it; for which purpoſe let your converſe be moſt with thoſe that ſpeak this Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and converſe with all that are any way capable in this Language; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke them to it, uſe them to it, neceſſitate them to it, if they will converſe with you, be as one that could hardly ſpeak any thing but it, from your youths accuſtom your ſelves to it, in your Houſes and among your familiars, initiate your ſelves herein, they will bear with your ſtammerings, which you might be aſhamed of before Strangers, and having once got, take heed you do not forget the Language, but inure your ſelves daily to it, you may travel through the World with it, it is one of the Learned Languages, that all Scholars <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

               </gap> have been bred in Chriſt's School underſtand, you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in have con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ſe with them; and it is no great matter if you are a Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian to others, if it quits you of their Company it does you a kindneſs, if
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:95740:268"/> this way you can be quit of vile and vain Companions, it is the honourableſt way you can be rid of them, and ſo far as <hi>ſeparated</hi> from them, you have Heaven's happineſs on Earth; better a great deal they ſhould be angred and eſtranged from you upon the holineſs of your Diſcourſe, than you grieved or defiled by the commonneſs or Profaneneſs of theirs. Though I muſt alſo tell you, if once this Diſcourſe was habitual to you, it might be better born in you, and no body would expect other from you, but as they had occaſions of dealing with you, might probably be awed into a Conformity to you.</p>
            <p>Further to engage you ſo far as may be in this holy ſtrain of Speech, take theſe Motives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. No Diſcourſe is ſo proper for you as Chriſtians,<note place="margin">Motives.</note> it being the Language of the Countrey to which you do belong; further, your concerns generally lye in the word, all that are worth ſpeaking of, why ſhould you in a manner talk of any thing elſe? It is almoſt an impertinency for a Chriſtian to talk of this World, wherein he is a Stranger, and whereof he can call little his own but a burying place. This was the utmoſt I find great <hi>Abraham</hi> to have graſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped after, or reckoned of in this World that he made ſure of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 23.4, 20. <hi>I am a Stranger and Sojourner with you, give me a poſſeſſion of a burying place. And the Field and the Cave was made ſure to</hi> Abraham <hi>for a Burial place.</hi> Truly this is all we are ſure of here below, that if we talk of any thing in this World, it is moſt proper to talk of our Graves, and our daily readineſs to drop into them: into which Diſcourſe <hi>David</hi> Naturally fell when his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny would not bear higher, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.4, &amp;c. <hi>Lord make me to know my end, and the meaſure of my days, what it is, that I may know how frail I am.</hi> But turn him to the Word, he has ſomething there; God, Chriſt, Men, Angels, Life, Death, things preſent, things to come, all things are his. Confine then to your own matters, eſpecially ſince you have ſo large a Field. Every one talks of their proper concerns: <hi>(Navita de ponto.)</hi> Have you nothing of your own to talk of? or is it not to compare with what others ſo much pleaſe themſelves to prattle about? For ſhame Chriſtians, that you alone ſhould rove and ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble at this rate; holy heavenly Diſcourſe is that one would expect from you, and that alone ſeems pertinent to you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. No Diſcourſe is ſo profitable. One may hear a deal of other chat, and be neither the better nor wiſer, or at leaſt we are inſtructed unto ſome little mean deſigns; but when we talk out of the Word, we are in the way of Learning or Teaching, what will be for our univerſal accompliſhment: for as he ſays, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. <hi>The Scripture is profitable for Doctrine, for Reproof, for Correction, for Inſtruction in Righteouſneſs, that the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, throughly furniſhed unto all good works.</hi> Yea, ſuch Diſcourſe does not only fit us for the work of <hi>this</hi> World, the beſt, the nobleſt Atchievements in it; but it prepares us for, and in a ſenſe enters us into the Work of the <hi>other</hi> World, for that I conceive lyes much in the holy uſe of the Tongue: we hear of no other imployment of the Saints in glory, but that they night and day are praiſing God, he is always in their eyes, he is ever in their mouth. The work of Heaven will not be uncouth to them, that have been much Exerciſed in holy Heavenly Diſcourſe on Earth; but for others, that can ſcarce frame their mouths to a good word on Earth, for my part I know not what they
<pb n="524" facs="tcp:95740:269"/> will do in Heaven, though I think there is no great danger of their coming thither.</p>
            <p n="3">3. No Diſcourſe is ſo pleaſant: next to the Songs of Angels, the pious conference of holy men, is the ſweeteſt melody our ears can be entertained with; other things comparatively found harſh to the things of God, neither at the inſtant affect the Ear with that pleaſure, nor afterwards leave it in that compoſure. To reflect a little by way of compariſon: And firſt let us liſten a little to what the World ſays; a buzze there is in both ears, but what do we hear? Such a man hath play'd the Knave, and ſuch a man hath play'd the Fool, ſuch a Family is at great Diſcord, or in great diſtreſs, ſuch a Nation is involved in War, or ſuch a Perſon hath ſhed the blood of War in Peace: for ordinary we hear nothing but what it is a vexation to hear, nothing but what may make our Ears to tingle; or if ought ſeems at preſent to tickle them, as profane Jeſts and idle ſtories may for a while do, this tickling ends in torment, the Ear is put out of Order, and the Heart as being defiled is not a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed. He could ſee ſo little pleaſure in the Speeches, that he abhorred the Songs of Sinners, as having no harmony in them, their Mirth was rather his Sorrow, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.5. <hi>It is better to hear the rebuke of the Wiſe, than for a man to hear the Song of Fools.</hi> But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. In liſtning to holy Diſcourſe, we hear of the Love of God, the glory of Heaven, the Graces that do ſhine in ſome, the Duties that are performed by others, we hear of an end that ſhall be put to all earthly troubles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the ſharpeſt ſufferings are allayed, and by what we may hear further, death it ſelf comes to be deſpiſed. Are the ſtories we hear on one Ear and the other to be compared? we may hearken long enough e're the Ear will be ſatisfied with hearing, except we chance to hear ſomething from Heaven; all the good News is in the Word of God, and to be heard from good men that bring us ſtories there-from.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By neglecting holy Diſcourſe you may loſe opportunities of good both to your ſelves and others, that you will wiſh you had taken.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It may be as to your ſelves you were in Company with Perſons eminent for grace and knowledg, here was an opportunity of doing your own Soul good, but by the ſtream of your impertinent tattle, all ſavoury Diſcourſe was diverted, that Seaſon was neglected, afterwards you ſee your lack of knowledg, the Inſtrument is removed, Ah Fools! do we not then cry out of our ſelves, the opportunity is gone, and we are undone? How muſt it gall an awakned Jew to think what Diſcourſe he had with Jeſus Chriſt? Is it lawful to give Tribute to <hi>Caeſar?</hi> Here is a Woman caught in Adultery. Why do not thy Diſciples Faſt? &amp;c. Ah! had I nothing elſe to enquire of my Saviour? Would it not have been more pertinent to have asked, what I ſhall do to be ſaved? But he is gone, and I muſt die in my ſins. How many Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have we ſent away, that have had a word of wiſdom in their hearts, having learnt only what a Clock it was, what weather, what News, forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ask our own hearts, what all this was to us, and enquire of them things worthy of their wiſdom and our learning? Secondly, as to others, you may rue the opportunities you have loſt; here lay a poor wretch with
<pb n="525" facs="tcp:95740:269"/> one foot in Hell, would he not have ſtarted back, if he had had light to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover his Danger? Well, you are together, ſomething you muſt ſay, the ſame breath would ſerve for a compaſſionate admonition as a complacent im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinency, which will redound to neither of your advantages; you part, the man dies in his ſins, and in the midſt of Hell cryes out againſt you, one word of yours might have ſaved me, you had me, you might have told me of my danger, you forbore, I hardned, the Lord reward your negligence. Oh give not poor Souls occaſion to rail at you in Hell for your ſinful ſilence or imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent converſe with them here on Earth.</p>
            <p>You will pretend (it may be) want of matter in excuſe for your forbearing holy Diſcourſe. <label type="milestone">

               </label> 
            </p>
            <p>No, Friend, it was want of mind, <label type="milestone">

               </label> thou art not ſtraitned in thy Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, but in thy ſelf, Religious matter has no <hi>End;</hi> Eternity is not ſufficient for it, but thou art reſolved alſo it ſhall have <hi>no beginning.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, you know your duty, and do as likes you.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In order to the right management of our Tongue, eſpecial regard muſt be had to its ſcope, what is aimed at in every motion of it, either immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately or ultimately; for without ſome ſcope it is vain talk, and according to the goodneſs or badneſs of our ſcope, it is ordinarily good or bad talk: I ſay ordinarily, for ſome talk is ſo bad that it is ſcarce capable of a good ſcope, much leſs of being made good by it, yet leſs evil it does become, to inſtance in blaſphemy and lying, great moral evils both in their own Nature, and no deſign can deſtroy the Nature of them, in that the Word of God allows not, but forbids the doing of evil that good may come of it, yet ſpeeches mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially ſo have been paſſed over, the evil as of ſimplicity pardoned, and the good aimed at in them as of ſincerity rather rewarded. As <hi>Paul, Rahab,</hi> and the <hi>Egyptian</hi> Midwives might be inſtances; but let us take heed of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them Examples. But ordinarily, as I ſaid before, the Scope does much unto the Specification of the Speech, ſo much,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That fair Speeches become foul, if dirty deſigns be couched under them or carried on by them; he cryes out therefore for help againſt the Flatterer, as if he was a Murtherer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.1, 2, 3. <hi>Help Lord for the faithful fail, they ſpeak vanity every one with his Neighbour with flattering lips,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Lord ſhall cut off all flattering lips.</hi> Pſal. 55.21. <hi>His words are ſofter than Oyl, yet are they drawn Swords.</hi> The like may be ſaid of the fawning Woman, that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices to vice, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.3, 4. <hi>The Lips of a ſtrange Woman drop as an Honey-comb, but her end is bitter as Wormwood, ſharp as a two-edged Sword.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Good Speeches become evil to the uſers of them, if evil be meant by them: as if we couch under them to cover ſinful purpoſes, or colour ſinful practices, hereby they are profaned, and the holier they be, the wickeder; <hi>Woe to you, ye devour Widow's Houſes, and for a pretence make long Prayers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Our moſt common Speeches, that might otherwiſe ſeem culpable, are not only allowable, but commendable as they may be referred unto ſome good purpoſe. As firſt for the remiſſion of a mind over-bent and burthened with ſerious matter, that one may return with more vigor to it.
<pb n="526" facs="tcp:95740:270"/> Secondly, For the prevention of worſe Diſcourſe, where better will not be entertained. Thirdly, For inſinuation into bad men, that we may gain an opportunity of doing good upon them; and for introduction into better Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; which abruptly cannot be brought in.</p>
            <p>So much then depending upon the Scope of our Diſcourſe, let me give two Cautions hereon.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Caution.</note>Firſt, That none Pride themſelves in the material goodneſs of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe; if the deſign be bad, it is like a fair Apple rotten at the core.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That we judg none raſhly for the ſeeming commonneſs of their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, if it be not their common dialect, and eſpecially if they are among common ſpirited People, there may be a pious guile in it, a reaſon for it, and it is Charity to ſuppoſe it: but let every one judg himſelf, who only hath a Capacity to know himſelf, and let us all be cautious however, that we lay not a ſtumbling block before a weak Brother.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Mong the many Sins for which God is contending with <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and eſpecially with the Profeſſors of Religion in it, I doubt not but one, and that none of the leaſt is, the groſs miſgovernment of their Tongues. The abuſes of the Tongue are many, one whereof is the malignity of it. And whereas in <hi>David</hi>'s time a malignant and virulent Tongue was the badg and cognizance of an Atheiſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 59.7. <hi>Behold, they belch out with their mouths, Swords are in their Lips, for who (ſay they) doth hear?</hi> Now alas! this Spot is become the Spot of God's Children, and high profeſſors of Religion. A man can ſcarce come into any Company, but his Ears ſhall be filled with cenſures, detractions, reproaches, Party againſt Party, Perſon againſt Perſon: Inſtead of that old Chriſtian Love and Charity, for which the Ancient Chriſtians were noted and applauded even by their Adverſaries, (<hi>Behold,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>how the Chriſtians love one another.</hi>) Mens hearts are generally full of rancour, and their Tongues of ſharp refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, contemptuous and reproachful expreſſions, cenſures and ſlanders, againſt their abſent, and oft-times innocent and more worthy Brethren. This is the Diſeaſe which I would endeavour to adminiſter ſome Phyſick to from theſe words.</p>
            <p>The Coherence is plain. <hi>David</hi> propoſeth a Queſtion, verſe 1. <hi>Lord, who ſhall abide in thy Tabernacle? Who ſhall dwell in thy holy Hill?</hi> By which you
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:95740:271"/> may underſtand either <hi>Sion,</hi> where the Ark then was, or <hi>Moriah,</hi> where the Temple was to be Built, and by either of them, the Church of God here, and eſpecially the Heavenly Temple hereafter.</p>
            <p>So that it is as if <hi>David</hi> had ſaid, and asked, what is the qualification of the true Members of God's Church, of the Citizens of the New <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> By what properties are they known and diſtinguiſhed from other men? To this <hi>David</hi> doth not anſwer, that they are ſo differenced by their high Talks, by their crying out upon the ſins of other men, or the wickedneſs of the times, by their frequent attendance at God's Tabernacle; but by the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs of their Hearts, by the good Government of their Tongues, by the holineſs of their Lives. Verſe 2. <hi>He that walketh uprightly, and work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Righteouſneſs, and ſpeaketh the Truth in his heart.</hi> And in this 3d. Verſe that I have now read, <hi>He that backbiteth not with his Tongue, nor doth evil to his Neighbour, nor taketh up a Reproach againſt his Neighbour.</hi> It is the laſt clauſe which I intend to ſpeak to, becauſe it will comprehend the former. <hi>Nor taketh up a Reproach againſt his Neighbour.</hi> The words I ſhall explain in the handling of the Doctrine, which is this,</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> 
               <hi>It is the Duty, and muſt be the care of every true Chriſtian, not to take up a Reproach againſt his Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall firſt explain the point, then prove it, and laſtly, apply it.</p>
            <p>For Explanation, three things are to be enquired into.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Who is my <hi>Neighbour?</hi> There are ſome men of Name in the world that will tell you, that in the Language of the Old Teſtament, by <hi>Neighbour</hi> is to be underſtood one of the ſame Countrey and Religion, <hi>Popularis Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lita,</hi> and it is the peculiarity of the Goſpel that every man is made my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. But if we examine Scripture, we ſhall find this to be a groſs miſtake. I need not go farther for the confutation of it, than to the Decalogue it ſelf; <hi>Thou ſhalt not bear falſe Witneſs againſt thy Neighbour.</hi> I ſuppoſe it will ſeem a very hard ſaying to affirm that it is Lawful to bear falſe Witneſs againſt a Stranger. So when God commands, <hi>Thou ſhalt not lye carnally with thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Wife,</hi> Lev. 18.20. I preſume theſe Gentlemen would not allow them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that Liberty with the Wife of a Stranger. If God may be his own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter, this Controverſie will quickly be ended from <hi>Lev.</hi> 19. <hi>ch.</hi> where if you compare two Verſes, Verſe 18. <hi>Thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> with Verſe 34. <hi>But the Stranger that Dwelleth with you ſhall be unto you as one born among you, and thou ſhalt love him as thy ſelf;</hi> you will not need the help of an Artiſt to form this Concluſion, that the <hi>Stranger</hi> is in God's Account, and ought to be in mine Account, my <hi>Neighbour.</hi> To the ſame purpoſe you may pleaſe to compare two other places of Scripture together, <hi>Deut.</hi> 22.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſee thy Brother's Aſs nor his Ox fall down by the way, and hide thy ſelf from them: thou ſhalt ſurely help him to lift them up again,</hi> with <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.4, 5. <hi>If thou meet thine Enemie's Ox or his Aſs going aſtray, thou ſhalt ſurely bring him back again. If thou ſeeſt the Aſs of him that hateth thee lying under his Burthen thou ſhalt help him up.</hi> He who is my <hi>Brother,</hi> which is nearer than a <hi>Neighbour,</hi> in the one place, is mine <hi>Enemy,</hi> and he that <hi>hateth me</hi> in
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:95740:271"/> another place. And it is further obſervable to this end, that the Hebrew word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> and the Greek <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> a <hi>Neighbour</hi> is uſually rendred in Scripture by <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>another,</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.8.9. <hi>He that loveth</hi> another <hi>hath fulfilled the Law, for the Law ſaith thou ſhalt love thy</hi> Neighbour <hi>as thy ſelf.</hi> Moſt true therefore is that of St. <hi>Auguſtine, Proximus eſt omnis homo homini, every man is a Neighbour to any other man.</hi> Nay, the more intelligent part of the Jews were of this Opinion, and <hi>Kimchi</hi> upon theſe words ſaith, <hi>He is called my Neighbour with whom I have any buſineſs.</hi> And the Scribe, of whom we read, <hi>Luke</hi> 10. knowing the miſtakes of many of his Brethren, asks our Saviour this Queſtion, Verſe 29. <hi>Who is my Neighbour?</hi> And our Saviour gives him an Anſwer, the ſum whereof is this, that even the <hi>Samaritan</hi> was to be looked upon as his Neighbour.</p>
            <p n="2">2. What is a Reproach?</p>
            <p>I anſwer in general, it is nothing elſe but an evil Report, or an evil Speech, unduly uttered concerning another.</p>
            <p>Now a Report is evil two wayes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When it is evil in it ſelf, <hi>a falſe Report:</hi> when a man belyes his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and bears falſe Witneſs againſt him, either in judicial proceedings, or in common Converſation. Theſe kind of evil Reports <hi>David</hi> was Exerciſed with, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 35.11. <hi>Falſe witneſs did riſe up, they laid to my charge things that I knew not.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When it is evil to a man's Neighbour, when your Speech tends to your Neighbour's diſparagement and defamation. And here I muſt inform you that a man may be guilty of Reproaching men by Commendations, as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> ſpeaks of his Enemy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55.21. <hi>His words were ſmoother than Oyl, yet were they drawn Swords.</hi> It is the uſual Practice of ſome men to ſmooth the way to a reproach by a Commendation, and to raiſe a man's reputation, that he may tumble it down with more advantage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When a man publiſheth a Neighbour's ſecret Infirmities or ſins. This all caſuiſts allow to be a kind of Detraction: and good Reaſon; for though the matter may be true and good; yet the principle from whence this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds is evil. It proceeds from want of Love to my Neighbour, and of the juſt care that I ought to have of his Credit: And the Ends either of Speaker, or of the Speech in its own Nature, or of both, are evil, even to bring his Neighbour into contempt or diſgrace.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When a man aggravates the real or ſuppoſed faults of his Neighbour either in Opinion or in practice. Certainly the Profeſſors of this Age, and this City, are deeply guilty in both theſe reſpects.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In aggravating other men's real or ſuppoſed Errours and miſtakes, Often-times men call that an Errour through their own Ignorance or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicate Opinion, which in the judgment of far wiſer and better men than themſelves, and in reality, is a precious Truth of God: And the pardona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble miſtakes of their Neighbour they decry as fundamental and damnable Errours, or at leaſt as Errours dangerous to Salvation. I am far from pleading for Errours that are really damnable, or highly dangerous, ſuch as thoſe of the <hi>Papiſts, Socinians, Quakers,</hi> and the like: But there are other and leſſer differences among, <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> who <hi>holding the Head</hi> as
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:95740:272"/> the Apoſtle ſpeaks, differ in Doctrines of leſs moment, or in the methods and modes of Worſhip, in Rites and Ceremonies, which poſſibly one man thinks to be neceſſary, another to be Lawful and indifferent, another ſinful; and by theſe differing Opinions it is lamentable to conſider, and, I confeſs, I cannot think of it without horror and loathing, how Proteſtants traduce and defame one another. The one is <hi>Superſtitious, Idolatrous, a Formaliſt, a Profane Perſon, and one that hath no ſenſe of Religion.</hi> The other is an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retick, a Schiſmatick, a Fanatick, a licentious lawleſs Perſon, that follows his own ſenſuality, and hath not the fear of God before his Eyes.</hi> Thus they mutually rail at one another, as if they had neither ſenſe nor Conſcience. Nay, the Diſeaſe is grown to that height, that not content to cenſure men's Opinions, they will alſo judg of their Conſciences, and ſecret intentions, as if they maintained ſuch Doctrines againſt the light of their own Conſciences. A Cenſure which proceeds from deep Ignorance of the merits of the Cauſe. It were, I confeſs, a very deſirable thing that all men were of one mind, and Chriſtians indeed are to labour for it, and to pray for it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.10. <hi>I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech you Brethren, by the Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that you all ſpeak the ſame things, that there be no Diviſions among you, but that you be perfectly joyned together in the ſame mind and in the ſame judgment.</hi> But if a man conſider the great weakneſs of moſt men's underſtandings, the Infinite varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their parts and apprehenſions, Educations, Inclinations, Intereſts, or what the Scripture hath fore-told, <hi>There muſt be Hereſies, that they that are approved may be made manifeſt,</hi> I think he will conclude, that he who ſhall expect this abſolute harmony and uniformity in this World muſt either dream or dote. And therefore the Holy Ghoſt hath directed us what to do in caſe of ſuch differences of judgment, to wit, to talk charitably toward thoſe that differ from us: <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.15. <hi>If thy Brother be grieved with thy meat, now walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt thou not charitably:</hi> And to agree with others as far as we can, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.15, 16. <hi>Let us therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus, indeed and if in any thing you be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you. Notwithſtanding whereto you have already attained, let us walk by the ſame Rule, let us mind the ſame things.</hi> But for thoſe mutual reproaches and cenſures one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, I muſt take the boldneſs to charge you all, as you tender your Salvation, to have a care of them: for though theſe points wherein you differ be diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, yet this is out of all diſpute, that you ought <hi>to love your Neighbour as your ſelf,</hi> and that you ought not <hi>to take up a Reproach againſt your Neighbour.</hi> And therefore take heed, leſt while you condemn another man for diſputable and leſſer Errors, you do not run into an indiſputable Crime and fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Miſcarriage.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Men are guilty of reproaching their Neighbours by aggravating their Errors in practice and converſation: When men cenſure and reproach others for things indifferent and of ſmall moment. As for Example; In their Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits and Garbs. I am not Ignorant that there are great miſcarriages in men's Habits, and that the Buſh that hangs at the door doth frequently diſcover what is within, and tell the pride of men's hearts, and there are certain bounds and limits to be obſerved, that men's Habits be agreeable to their Quality, Eſtate, Calling, and Condition in the World: but yet there is a
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:95740:272"/> juſt Latitude in theſe things, the Lawfulneſs of them doth not conſiſt in a Mathematical point, theſe are to be regulated by the Cuſtoms of times and places: Now if a man ſee another that doth a little vary from his fancy or practice, whoſe Garb is a little more Ornamental than his, though not much extravagant, if now he judgeth the ſtate of this man, and concludes him to be a profane or carnal Perſon, this is a <hi>Reproach.</hi> So again, when a man com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits ſome miſcarriage towards his Neighbour through careleſsneſs, or forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, or miſtake, it is a common thing for men to charge it as a malicious deſign intended for their hurt; this is a <hi>Reproach.</hi> And you may eaſily mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply Inſtances in your own thoughts.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Queſtion, What is it to take up a Reproach againſt a man's Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour?</p>
            <p>I anſwer: It is a defective manner of expreſſion: and therefore is diverſly ſupplied; but eſpecially and moſt reaſonably two ways, and accordingly a man may be guilty of taking up a reproach againſt his Neighbour two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he takes it up into his mouth. The Hebrew word is often ſo uſed: As <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.7. <hi>Thou ſhalt not take the Name of the Lord thy God in vain. Not take it,</hi> that is, not lift it up upon thy Tongue, or not take it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thy Mouth. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 14.4. <hi>Thou ſhalt take up this Proverb againſt the King of Babylon;</hi> that is, thou ſhalt take it up into thy lips, thou ſhalt utter and publiſh it. Thus <hi>Ezek.</hi> 26.17. <hi>They ſhall take up a lamentation for thee:</hi> which is explained in the following words, <hi>and ſay to thee, how art thou deſtroyed?</hi> And therefore elſewhere the word, <hi>Lips</hi> or <hi>mouth,</hi> is added: as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.4. <hi>Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take up their names into my lips.</hi> Pſal. 50.16. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldeſt take my Covenant into thy mouth?</hi> And this phraſe of <hi>taking up,</hi> may poſſibly reſpect the ſcituation of the Mouth above the Heart; which, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Opinion of the Hebrews, is the ſeat of the Underſtanding: As if he had ſaid; If there ſhould riſe in thy heart any evil thought or device againſt thy Brother, let it die there, let it never come up into thy mouth. Now in this reſpect a man may be guilty of this ſin of taking up a reproach againſt his Neighbour two ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When he is the Author and firſt raiſer of a reproach: Such as <hi>Sanballat</hi> was, <hi>Neh.</hi> 6.8. <hi>There are no ſuch things as thou ſayeſt, but thou feigneſt them of thy own heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When a man is the Spreader or Promoter of it. Suppoſe it comes from another Fountain, if thou art the Conduit-pipe by whom it is conveyed to others, thou art guilty of it. <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.16. <hi>Thou ſhalt not go up and down as a Tale-bearer among thy people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. When a man takes it into his Ear: So ſome expound theſe words, thou ſhalt not receive, not admit, not endure a reproach againſt thy Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. You know the Receiver of ſtoln goods is as obnoxious to the Law, as he that takes them away: So then a man may be guilty of this ſin, not
<pb n="532" facs="tcp:95740:273"/> only by ſpeaking, but alſo by the hearing of a reproach againſt his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour; and ſo he may be three ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When a man quietly permits it, and gives no check to it. This is certain, the great Law of Charity commands me not only to do no hurt to my Neighbour, but alſo to ſuffer no hurt to be done to him, which it lyes in my power to prevent or remove. If another ſet his houſe on fire, I muſt lend my help to quench it; I muſt pull my Neighbour's Ox out of the Pit, though another man hath caſt him in; and conſequently, when the good name of my Neighbour is invaded by another, if I patiently bear the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, I make my ſelf guilty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When a man hears a reproach againſt his Neighbour greedily, and with delight. It is a ſin, and that of no ſmall ſize, for a man to take pleaſure in the ſins of others; and therefore the Apoſtle makes it an aggravation of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.32. <hi>Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit ſuch things are worthy of death, not only do the ſame, but alſo have pleaſure in them that do them:</hi> 1 Cor. 13.6. <hi>Charity rejoyceth not in iniquity, but rejoyceth in the truth.</hi> Conſider, I beſeech you, the commonneſs of this ſin; if a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach be faſtned upon one who is a man's Enemy, or of another Party, men commonly hear ſuch reproaches with delight, not conſidering that this is not only a blemiſh to his own Party, but alſo a blot to Chriſtianity, a reproach to the Proteſtant Religion, a ſin againſt God, and againſt the Goſpel, a ſcandal to men; and theſe things ſhould rather call for tears, than laughter, and approbation. And therefore when a man ſeems to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove another man's reproach, and encourage the reproacher, he involves himſelf in the guilt of it. It is the ſaying of a very Learned Man upon the Proverbs, <hi>That it is not eaſie to know whether is a greater ſinner, or whether is the greater plague to a Commonwealth, he that ſpreads a reproach, or he that willingly receives it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. When a man eaſily believes a reproach. It is ſaid indeed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Charity believeth all things;</hi> but the object of this belief is the good of my Neighbour, and not his evil. Charity readily believes well concerning its Neighbour, where there is the leaſt colour or foundation for it; but it is ſlow to believe evil concerning him: and when a man is prone to believe evil concerning another man, it is a great ſign of an uncharitable diſpoſition; the reaſon is, becauſe men do moſt readily believe thoſe things which comply with their own deſires and inclinations; as in Wars and differing Factions, every man is apt to believe good tidings concerning his own Party. Good men are the leaſt ſuſpitious, and ſloweſt to believe evil of others: of which you have a remarkable inſtance in <hi>Gedaliah;</hi> when <hi>Johanan</hi> told him of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael</hi>'s deſign to murther him, it is ſaid, <hi>he believed him not,</hi> Jer. 40.14. And when it was preſſed upon him a ſecond time, and <hi>Johanan</hi> offered to puniſh the Conſpirator, and to prevent the Execution of the Treaſon, he ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt not do this thing, for thou ſpeakeſt falſly concerning</hi> Iſmael, <hi>verſe</hi> 16.</p>
            <p>You may obſerve how backward fond Parents are to believe any ill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port concerning their Children; and whence doth this proceed? even from an inordinate love and kindneſs to them: and therefore on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary,
<pb n="533" facs="tcp:95740:273"/> men's credulity unto evil reports concerning their Neighbours doth proceed from want of love and affection to them. So much for the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Proof of the Doctrine ſhall conſiſt in the repreſentation of the ſinfulneſs and injury of this practice of cenſuring, back-biting, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching of others. And that I may more effectually diſſwade and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fright my ſelf and you from it, I ſhall diſcover to you how pregnant a ſin this is: There is a complication of injuries in it. It is <hi>injurious;</hi> Firſt, <hi>to God;</hi> Secondly, <hi>to your ſelves;</hi> Thirdly, <hi>to the Party cenſured or reproached;</hi> Fourthly, <hi>to other men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To God and Chriſt in divers particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is an invaſion of God's Prerogative. You know how dangerous a Crime this is, when it is committed againſt an Earthly Prince: nor can you in reaſon think it leſs criminal and hazardous, when it is committed againſt him who <hi>accepteth not the perſons of Princes,</hi> and who <hi>is greater than the Kings of the Earth.</hi> And therefore obſerve how ſeverely God rebukes this ſin in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> Chap. 14. when men did cenſure and Reproach one another, either for the Obſervation of dayes and meats, as guilty of Superſtition, or for the neglect of them, as proceeding from li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, what ſaith the Apoſtle? <hi>Who art thou that judgeſt another man's Servant?</hi> verſe 4. And, <hi>But why doſt thou judg or ſet at naught thy Brother? For we muſt all ſtand before the Judgment-ſeat of Chriſt,</hi> verſe 10. As if he had ſaid, thou doſt ſet thy ſelf in the Throne of God, and thou doſt take God's work out of his hands.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is a manifeſt breach of the Laws of God and of Chriſt. The things, as I ſaid before, which thou doſt cenſure and reproach another for, are often-times doubtful and liable to diſpute, but the Command of God againſt this ſinful practice, is evident, and without controverſie. He, whom thou cenſureſt, poſſibly may ſin, but thou that doſt reproach him, certainly doſt ſin, and that againſt clear Light, and ſo thou doſt put thy ſelf into the Number of thoſe that <hi>rebel againſt the Light,</hi> which is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned as a great aggravation of ſin, <hi>Job</hi> 24.13. The Law of God hath ſo evidently forbidden this ſin, that if thy Conſcience doth not ſmite thee for it, if thou canſt go on quietly in this ſin, it is a ſign thou art in a deep ſleep, if not <hi>dead in Treſpaſſes and ſins.</hi> That this practice is ſo great a breach of the Laws of God, and of Chriſt, will appear by theſe particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is againſt particular and expreſs Scriptures, forbidding this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. The Text is evident, it is not like ſome places of Scripture, which are <hi>hard to be underſtood,</hi> and ſoon <hi>wreſted,</hi> but it is ſo plain, that <hi>he that runs may read it,</hi> none ſhall dwell in God's holy Hill that allow themſelves in this practice. Again, <hi>Exod.</hi> 23.1. <hi>Thou ſhalt not raiſe a falſe Report againſt thy Brother.</hi> A <hi>falſe Report,</hi> either that which thou knoweſt to be falſe, then thou art guilty of Forgery: or that which in the Iſſue ſhall be found to be falſe, in which caſe thou art guilty of raſhneſs and uncharita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs. In the Hebrew it is <hi>a vain Report,</hi> a report that wants the ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity of a through information, and of real uſe to thy Neighbour, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4.11.
<pb n="534" facs="tcp:95740:274"/> 
               <hi>Speak not evil of another, for he that ſpeaketh evil of his Brother, and judgeth his Brother, ſpeaketh evil of the Law, and judgeth the Law,</hi> and ſo, in the groſſeſt ſenſe, is an Antinomian, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.2. Miniſters muſt put people in mind <hi>to ſpeak evil of no man.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. This is againſt the fundamental Law of Love and Charity, which is the chief of the Laws of God, ſo great a Law that the reſt of the Laws of God muſt give place to it; Sacrifice, Sabbaths, The Worſhip and Service of God muſt frequently give place unto this duty of Mercy and Charity to men; by which you may ſee, as how great a duty this is, ſo how great a ſin the violation of this command is. God accepts no man's perſon, he regards no Service, where this is wanting. Though men pretend, or expreſs never ſo much love to God, though they do or ſuffer never ſo much for him, yet <hi>if they have not Charity, it proſiteth nothing,</hi> 1 Cor. 13.3. and 1 Joh. 3.10. <hi>In this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil, whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever doth not righteouſneſs is not of God, neither he that loveth not his Brother,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.20. <hi>If a man ſay I love God, and hateth his Brother, he is a Lyar: for he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But poſſibly ſome may ask, who then is my Brother, to the love of whom I am thus obliged? Poſſibly he is one of my own party and Religion, and ſuch I do love. No, every man is thy Brother in this ſenſe and the object of thy Love. 'Tis true, good men are the principal objects of thy Love: but not the only objects of it, the commands of the Goſpel in this matter are general, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.17. <hi>Honour all men, love the Brother-hood,</hi> that is, Love them in a more eminent degree, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have opportunity let us do good to all men, eſpecially to the Houſhold of Faith.</hi> But now, all Perſons, yea, even thoſe that cenſure and reproach others, will pretend they love them: but be not deceived, if thou doſt ſincerely love thy Neighbour, thou wilt be ready to do all good Offices for him, to ſeek his Good, to maintain his Credit, to Interpret all things in the beſt ſenſe, to cover his failings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Charity will cover a multitude of ſins.</hi> Didſt thou love thy Neighbour, thou wouldſt not be ſo apt to cenſure him, ſo greedy to hear, nor ſo ready to believe, evil reports concerning him. When God ſhall come at the laſt day to try men's Love to their Brethren by the Rules and Characters of it, which he did preſcribe in the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> 13th. Chapter, I doubt multitudes of Perſons will be found deeply guilty, that thought themſelves in a manner wholly Innocent. You ſhould do well to ſtudy that Chapter, and to labour throughly to underſtand it, and that I commend to you as an excellent Antidote againſt this wicked practice.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is a ſin againſt that great and Royal Law of Chriſt, which even the Heathens have admired, and the Emperour <hi>Severus</hi> did ſo highly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.12. <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.</hi> Now let your own Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences anſwer the Queſtion, would you be thus dealt with by others? Would you have all your Infirmities ſharply cenſured? Your ſecret miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages publiſhed to the World? The whole courſe of your Lives ript
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:95740:274"/> up, and all your actions ſeverely examined? No, no, they that are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to cenſure the real or ſuppoſed miſcarriages of others, would have their own more tenderly dealt with: And generally thoſe that are moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judges of others are moſt partial to themſelves: they that will moſt freely defame other men will not endure to be reproved and admoniſhed themſelves. They that will turn the edge of the Sword to others, would have the back only turned to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is ſin againſt the great Law of maintaining Peace amongſt men. This is preſcribed as a remedy againſt this very ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.9. <hi>Let us therefore follow after the things that make for Peace, and things wherewith we may Edifie one another.</hi> Heb. 12.4. <hi>Follow Peace with all men.</hi> Rom. 12.18. <hi>If it be poſſible, as much as lyeth in you, live peaceably with all men.</hi> He ſaith indeed, <hi>if it be poſſible,</hi> becauſe in ſome caſes it is impoſſible to have peace with wicked men without the neglect of our Duty, and without the loſs of Truth and Holineſs, but as far as it is poſſible, we are obliged to promote it. But what Peace can there be in the midſt of Cenſures and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches? The Natural Off-ſpring of ſuch Parents are Contentions, Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Animoſities; while Peace lyes bleeding and languiſhing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is againſt that great Command laid upon all Chriſtians, of excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling other men. Chriſt requires more from Chriſtians than he doth from other men, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.47. <hi>What do ye more than others?</hi> Chriſtians muſt be free from the Vices of other men, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.17 <hi>This I ſay therefore, and teſtifie in the Lord, that ye walk not as other Gentiles walk.</hi> So <hi>Luke</hi> 22.25, 26. <hi>The Kings of the Gentiles Exerciſe Lordſhip,</hi> they are Proud, Ambitious, Impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious. <hi>But it ſhall not be ſo among you.</hi> Chriſtians muſt be in the World <hi>like Lights ſhining in a dark place.</hi> They muſt have all the Vertues that others have, and they muſt be clean from all the Vices and Luſts in which others Live. Now the very Heathens have condemned this Practice of Reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and traducing others: Detractors were infamous amongſt them, and therefore it is a ſhame this ſhould be practiſed by Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is a ſin againſt the whole deſign and ſcope of the Scriptures. Theſe are, as I may ſay, the two Poles, upon which the Heavenly Globe of the Scripture turns; the Love of God, and the Love of our Neighbour. <hi>Thou ſhalt love the Lord thy God with all thy Heart, and thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> Mat. 22.37, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Rom. 13.10. <hi>Love is the fulfilling of the Law,</hi> and the Law is enforced by Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.34. <hi>A new Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment give I unto you, that ye love one another.</hi> So then, all the Scripture hath but one Neck, and this the Detractor cuts off, and ſo makes himſelf the greateſt Anti-Scripturiſt in the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This is a great injury to God, becauſe it is a Confederacy with God's greateſt Enemy, the Devil. God judgeth of men's Relations by their Works, and not by their talks, <hi>John</hi> 8.39. <hi>If ye were</hi> Abraham<hi>'s Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, you would do the Works of</hi> Abraham. And verſe 44. <hi>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and the Luſts of your Father ye will do.</hi> Now this among others is the Devil's great Work and Office, who is hence called <hi>the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer of the Brethren,</hi> Rev. 12.10. And from whence he hath his Name
<pb n="536" facs="tcp:95740:275"/> 
               <hi>Diabolus,</hi> which is <hi>a Calumniator, a Slanderer, a Reproacher.</hi> And theſe Men as they do the Devil's Work, ſo they are called by the Devil's name, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Not Slanderers,</hi> in the Greek, <hi>not Devils:</hi> And as they do the Devil's Work, ſo they ſerve the Devil's great Deſign. God is Love, and therefore his deſign is to promote Love in the World. The Devil is a malignant and hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Spirit, and his work is to promote hatred, contention, and ſtrife among men: And that is effectually done by this way.</p>
            <p n="2">2. This is an injury to thy ſelf in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Hereby thou doſt contract guilt, the worſt of all evils. A man's ſin may injure another Man; but the greateſt and the worſt part of it falls upon his own head. <hi>Wickedneſs,</hi> ſaith <hi>Seneca, drinketh up the greateſt part of it's own poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> Prov. 8.36. <hi>He that ſinneth againſt me wrongeth his own Soul.</hi> Thou woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt another Man's Fame, but thou woundeſt thy own Conſcience; which of theſe is the worſt? He whom thou reproacheſt gets a blot before men; and thou doſt procure to thy ſelf a blot before God. Thou accuſeſt him before other Men, and thy Conſcience will accuſe thee for it before God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby thou doſt expell or weaken that excellent Grace of Love, that neceſſary and fundamental Grace, that ſweet and amiable Grace. As all Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is a reward to it ſelf, ſo is this in a more ſpecial manner. Infinite is the pleaſure of the Holy Soul in loving God, and loving all Men, and loving E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies. O this is a moſt delightful Work! And on the contrary, Hatred, and Malice, and Envy, as they are moſt ſinful, ſo are they very miſerable works, and a great Torment to him that hath them; while the mind of a wicked malicious man is <hi>like the raging Sea,</hi> continually <hi>caſting up mire and dirt,</hi> and is its own Tormentor. The mind of a good Man exerciſing it ſelf in love is, as it were, <hi>a Sea of Glaſs like unto Cryſtal,</hi> calm and ſerene, it enjoys God, and it ſelf, and other men, yea, even a man's Enemies: By this Holy Art a Man may get comfort out of his Enemies whether they will or no.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hereby thou doſt lay a Foundation for thy own Reproach, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1, 2. <hi>Judge not, that ye be not judged, for with what Judgment ye judge, ye ſhall be judged, and with what meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again.</hi> Methinks this Text ſhould ſtrike a terrour into all Perſons who are guilty of this ſin. The Law of Retaliation preſcribed by God is frequently inflicted by him alſo, <hi>James</hi> 2.13. <hi>He ſhall have Judgment without Mercy, that hath ſhewed no mercy.</hi> So that thou doſt ingage the great God againſt thee, to pour contempt upon thy Name, and to make thee a Reproach in the World.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is a great injury to the Perſon whom thou doſt cenſure and reproach, and that in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou doſt rob him of the beſt Treaſure which he hath in the World, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.1. <hi>A good Name is rather to be choſen than Riches,</hi> and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly thou art more Criminal than he that dyeth by the hands of Juſtice for taking away another Man's Goods: Thou robbeſt him of that which thou art not able to give him, thou robbeſt him of the moſt laſting good which he hath, and that which alone will abide after Death. So that thy cruelty
<pb n="537" facs="tcp:95740:275"/> extends beyond the Grave, and tends to this to make his Name rot above ground, while his Body rots in it: And this injury is the greater, becauſe it cannot be prevented; there is no Fence againſt this Vice, it is the Arrow that flyes by Night, which no man can either obſerve or avoid, and it is an Injury which can hardly be repaired. Breaches in mens Eſtates may be made up, Liberty loſt may be recovered, a Conſcience wounded may be hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: but a Reputation can hardly ever be reſtored. <hi>Calumnia re fortiter, aliquid adhaerebit, Slander a man reſolutely, and ſomething to be ſure will ſtick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Hereby thou doſt diſenable him from getting good both as to his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and as to his inward man.</p>
            <p>As to his outward Man.</p>
            <p>Who knows not the neceſſity of a good fame for the ſucceſsful manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a man's Worldly concernments? By one Act of this ſin thou mayſt poſſibly undo a man and all his Family.</p>
            <p>It hinders him alſo from receiving inward good as to the ſtate of his Soul: At leaſt he is not likely to get any good from thee. Whereas it is thy duty to <hi>rebuke thy Neighbour, and not to ſuffer ſin to reſt upon him,</hi> Levit. 19.17. This is the way to make that work altogether unſucceſsful; it ſtops his Ear againſt thy Counſels, it hardens his heart againſt thy admonitions, and many times ſuch Reproaches make men careleſs, and by degrees impudent; and when once they have loſt their Reputation by thy Calumnies, they are not careful to regain it, and it may be judge it impoſſible.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hereby thou doſt hinder him from doing of good in the World. It is certain a good Name is of abſolute neceſſity to make a man conſiderably ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable in the World; when a Man hath once loſt this, the very good which he doth is deſpiſed and diſ-regarded. And this reaſon eſpecially concerns you in the reproaching of three ſorts of Perſons, which I do therefore in a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial manner caution you againſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In reproaching of Magiſtrates, of Kings, and Perſons in Authority. Magiſtrates, though bad in themſelves, yet are to be looked upon as great bleſſings. And if we had the <hi>Perſian</hi> Experiment of abſolute Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy but for a few days, that every man might do that which ſeemed right in his own eyes, we ſhould all be ſenſible of this Truth. Now, the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate's Reputation is the great Supporter of that Majeſty and Authority, which he bears, and the Magiſtrates Authority is the Peoples benefit. And therefore all Perſons ſhould be tender in this particular, they ſhould not expoſe Kings and Magiſtrates to contempt and ſcorn, nor beget irreverence in People to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them. And therefore they ought to take heed not only of divulging falſe reports concerning them, but even ſuch as poſſibly may be true, they muſt take heed of publiſhing the ſecret miſcarriages of Princes, for this, as I told you, is a ſin againſt any Man; but much more againſt Perſons in Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Againſt Miniſters. Their Fame is moſt neceſſary for their uſefulneſs in the Word. And therefore when a Man defames a Miniſter, beſides that Injury which is common to other men, he doth this peculiar miſchief, he endeavours to rob the World of all the good which ſuch a Perſon may do
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:95740:276"/> in it. I cannot but take this occaſion to vent my great grief, and the ſcandal I juſtly take at thoſe Miniſters and Chriſtians, who, if a Man differ from them in ſome Doctrines or Rites of leſs moment, (though otherwiſe never ſo eminent,) make it their buſineſs to diſparage and beſpatter him, and think they do God good Service in blaſting his Reputation, repreſenting him as a Papiſt, Socinian, Time-ſerver, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the fear of God, conſider the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of this practice. Whatſoever good ſuch a Perſon might do in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing, converting, and building up of Souls, ſo far as this is hindered by thy means, the Blood of ſuch Souls will fall upon thy head: Nay, which is more, although good ſhould not be hindered by it, yet thou ſhalt anſwer for all that might have been hindered by it. And for this reaſon <hi>Conſtantine the Great</hi> did profeſs, that if he ſhould know any ſecret miſcarriage of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, he would cover it with a Mantle.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Againſt good men, or eminent Profeſſors of Religion: who, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, when they are bad, are the vileſt of Men, and when their ſins are known and publique, they ought to be uſed with moſt ſeverity, and ſuch ſhall have the hotteſt place in Hell who uſe Religion as a Cloak for their Villanies: yet when the ſins of ſuch Perſons are ſecret and ſcarce known, we ſhould take heed of ſpreading of them. <hi>Tell it not in</hi> Gath, <hi>publiſh it not in the ſtreets of</hi> Askelon, not for their ſakes, but for the ſake of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which infinitely ſuffers by their miſdemeanours, and the Reproaches which ariſe from them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This is a great Injury to other men, in theſe particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thou corrupteſt others by thy Example. Eſpecially Miniſters and eminent Profeſſors of Religion they ſhould above all others avoid this ſin, becauſe their Actions are preſidential: They that will not follow your coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, will imitate your Example: and though our Saviour hath cautioned us concerning the <hi>Phariſees, Mat.</hi> 23.3. <hi>What they bid or teach you, obſerve and do, but do not after their Works:</hi> yet in ſpite of all that Chriſt hath ſaid, Men will take a contrary courſe, they will not hear your Sermons, but will diligently attend to your converſations. O conſider this, every time another hears thee cenſuring and reproaching thy Neighbour, thou doſt in effect Preach and perſwade him to this Practice; Thou ſetteſt a Copy which other men may write after when thou art gone into another World, and no man knows how far the contagion of ſuch an evil Example may ſpread, nor how great a fire a little ſpark may kindle.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thou art a diſturber of Humane Society, an Incendiary in the place where thou dwelleſt. The Peace and tranquillity of Cities and Kingdoms is often diſturbed by this means. <hi>Whence come Wars and Fightings among you? Come they not hence, even from your Luſts that War in your Members?</hi> They do not come from Men's Luſts as they remain in their own hearts, for ſo they are ſecret and unknown to the World, but as they break out, firſt, in their Lips, and then in their hands.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thou art a great Enemy to the Church of God, however thou maiſt ſeem to thy ſelf, or others, a zealous Friend of it. It is not eaſie for any man to conceive the great miſchief which theſe Cenſures and Reproaches produce in the Church; they break the peace of it, and fill it with ſharp
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:95740:276"/> contentions and Diviſions: Yea, they ſtrike at the being of it. You know <hi>a Kingdom</hi> divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand: they do their part to pull down the glorious Building of the Church, ſo as one ſtone ſhould not be left upon another. They Eclipſe the glory of the Church, which doth not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in external ſplendour, in Riches and Ornaments; but in Love, Peace, and Unity among themſelves. This was <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s Beauty, that it was <hi>Built as a City that is Compact together,</hi> Pſal. 122.3. This hinders the growth and Progreſs of the Church, and of Religion. When Perſons profeſſing Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion allow themſelves in ſuch ſins which are not only offenſive to God, but alſo odious in the World, it fills the minds of men with powerful and invin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible prejudices againſt Religious men, and againſt Religion it ſelf for their ſakes. I muſt tell you, if the Profeſſors of Religion would learn the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of their Tongues, and the right ordering of their Converſations, it would be the likelieſt means to propagate Religion in the World. And, Chriſtians, if ever you would do this, do it now: never was it more ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or ſeaſonable to wipe off thoſe ſtains and blemiſhes which at this day lye upon Religion for the neglect of this Duty by the Profeſſors of it. And thrice bleſſed are all you that contribute to ſo glorious a work as the Reſtaura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that Beauty and Glory, which Religion once had in ſome of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance. But when the Tongues of Chriſtians are Exerciſed in this ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful practice, beſides the particular injury to the Perſon Reproached, it hinders the converſion and Salvation of others. Conſider, I beſeech you, a little the greatneſs of this ſin. You think it a great Crime, and ſo it was, in <hi>Ely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> the Sorcerer, who, when <hi>Sergius Paulus</hi> called for <hi>Barnabas</hi> and <hi>Saul,</hi> and deſired them to Preach to him the Word of God, <hi>withſtood them, ſeeking to turn the Deputy from the Faith,</hi> Acts 13.8. He did this by his words, and thou doſt it by thy Actions. Thou doſt the Devil's work in ſtealing the Seed of the Word of God out of Mens hearts, and making it unfruitful. Theſe practices beget in men a mean eſteem and contempt of God's Word, when they ſee how little good it doth to others, and how little power it hath with you that profeſs it.</p>
            <p>Before I come to the Application, two Queſtions are to be Anſwered.</p>
            <p n="1">1. May I not ſpeak evil of another Perſon when it is true?<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 1.</note>
            </p>
            <p>A Man may be faulty in ſo doing. The real ſecret faults of your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as I told you, you ought not unneceſſarily to publiſh. And ſuppoſe there be no untruth nor injuſtice in it, yet there is uncharitableneſs, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs in it, and that is a ſin. Thou wouldſt not have all Truth ſaid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning thy ſelf, nor all thy real faults publickly traduced. <hi>Out of thy own mouth will God Judg thee, O thou wicked Servant:</hi> Yea, thy own Tongue and Conſcience ſhall another day condemn thee.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You may ſpeak evil of another Perſon, when neceſſity requires it. It may be neceſſary ſometimes for his good, and ſo you may ſpeak evil of him unto thoſe that can help it: as a man may acquaint Parents with the miſcarriages of their Children, in order to their amendment. Thus, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.2. Joſeph <hi>brought to his Father the evil Report of his Brethren.</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times this may be neceſſary for the caution of others; as if I ſee a man ready to enter into intimate Friendſhip and Acquaintance with a Perſon
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:95740:277"/> whom I know to be highly vicious and dangerous: I may in ſuch a caſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him againſt it; For certainly if Charity commands me, when my Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour's Ox is ready to fall into a Pit, to do my endeavour ro prevent it; much more am I obliged to prevent the ruine of my Brother's Soul, when I ſee him ſo near deſtruction. But for a man to do this unneceſſarily, and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitably, this is the ſin I have been ſpeaking of.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If you will ſpeak evil of other Perſons, do it in the right method. Chriſt hath given us an Excellent Rule, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. <hi>If thy Brother ſhall treſpaſs againſt thee, go and tell him his fault between him and thee alone: if he ſhall hear thee, thou haſt gained thy Brother; But if he will not hear thee, take two or three more, and if he will not hear them, tell it to the Church.</hi> But if Men will be prepoſterous, and will not follow Chriſt's Order, but inſtead of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate admoniſhing, will publiſh men's faults to others, herein they make themſelves Tranſgreſſors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In doubtful caſes ſilence is the ſafeſt way. It is rarely men's duty to ſpeak evil of Men; and when it is not their duty to ſpeak, it is not their ſin to be ſilent. It is ſeldom that any ſuffer by my ſilence, or concealment of his fault; but great hazards are run, and many Perſons commonly are made ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers, by my publication. Now, as Charity commands me to paſs the moſt favourable judgment, ſo Wiſdom obligeth me to chuſe the ſafeſt courſe.</p>
            <p> 
               <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>2</label> But what if that Man I ſpeak againſt be an Enemy to God and his People? May not I in that caſe ſpeak evil of him? Doth not that Zeal I ow to God engage me to ſpeak evil of ſuch a man as far as I can with truth? This I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve is that which induceth many well meaning Perſons to this ſinful practice of detracting from divers worthy Perſons, Miniſters and others, as ſuppoſing them to be Enemies to God and to his ways, and ſo they think their reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cenſuring of ſuch Perſons is nothing but zeal for God.</p>
            <p>For Anſwer to this, conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is abundance of ſinful Zeal in the World, and in the Church: Therefore the Apoſtle gives us a Caution, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.18. <hi>It is good to be zealouſly affected in a good thing.</hi> Otherwiſe we know it was from Zeal that <hi>Paul</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.6. Zeal indeed is an Excellent grace in it ſelf, but nothing more frequently both pretended where it is not, and where Envy, Intereſt, or Malice, lye at the bottom; and abuſed where it is.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True Zeal hath an equal reſpect to all God's commands, and eſpecially to thoſe that are moſt plain and moſt conſiderable. It is at leaſt doubtful, whether the man thou traduceſt be an Enemy to God and his ways; ſure I am it is ſo with ſome Miniſters and Chriſtians that are highly cenſured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached by thoſe that differ from them, and it were great Impudence to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it: But this is a certain truth, and evident duty, <hi>Thou ſhalt not take up an evil reproach againſt thy Neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider how eaſie a miſtake is in this caſe, and how dangerous. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure he whom thou calleſt an Enemy to God, will upon enquiry be found a Friend of God and his ways. But what doſt thou mean by the ways of God? Poſſibly thy own ways or party that thou art engaged in, take heed of that. If you would Judg aright, you muſt diſtinguiſh between the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantials, and the eſſentials of the ways of God. Suppoſe a man be an
<pb n="541" facs="tcp:95740:277"/> Enemy to thy Party, and thy way and manner of Religious Worſhip and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; yea, let us ſuppoſe that thine is indeed the way of God, wherein yet thou maiſt be miſtaken: if now this man be an able and zealous Aſſertor of the ſubſtantial and fundamental truths of God, and ways of Holineſs, and this be attended with an Holy and exemplary Life, who dare ſay that this man is an enemy to God and his ways? O my Soul, come not into the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of ſuch Perſons.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You muſt not go out of God's way to meet with God's Enemies. If any man be really an Enemy of God and of his Truths and ways, I do not perſwade you to comply with him, or by ſinful ſilence to betray the cauſe of God: only let me entreat you to do God's work in God's way; you may apply your ſelves to him, and endeavour to convince him, you may ſpeak or write againſt his Doctrine, provided, you do it with modeſty and moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and not with that virulence and venom wherewith too many Books are now leavened. But for this way of Detraction and Reproach, it is a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable, and diſingenuous way, it is a ſinful and diſorderly way, it is an unprofitable and ineffectual way, and no way ſuitable either to the Nature of God whom you ſerve, or to the Rule and Example of our Bleſſed Saviour, or to the great principle of Love and Charity, or to that end which you are to aim at in all things, the honour of God, and the good of other men.</p>
            <p>Now I come to the Application.</p>

O that I could move your pity in this caſe! For the Lord's ſake pity your ſelves, and do not pollute and wound your Conſciences with this Crime: Pity your Brethren, let it ſuffice that godly Miniſters and Chriſtians are loaded with reproaches by wicked men, there is no need that you ſhould combine with them in this Diabolical work: You ſhould ſupport and ſtrengthen their hands againſt the reproaches of the ungodly World, and not add affliction to the afflicted. O pity the World, and pity the Church which Chriſt hath purchaſed with his own Blood, which methinks beſpeaks you in thoſe words, <hi>Job</hi> 19.21. <hi>Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O my Friends, for the hand of the Lord hath touched me:</hi> Pity the mad and miſerable World, and help it againſt this ſin, ſtop the bloody Iſſue, reſtrain this wicked practice amongſt men as much as poſſibly you can, and lament it before God, and for what you cannot do your ſelves, give God no reſt until he ſhall pleaſe to work a Cure.</p>

            <p n="1">1. Take heed of uncharitableneſs in all its kinds and degrees, Malice, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, Hatred; where theſe Diſeaſes are in the Heart, they will break out at the Lips. <hi>Out of the abundance of the Heart the mouth ſpeaketh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed of Loquacity and multitude of words. A Man need not ſeek far for perpetual motion, he may find it in ſome Perſons reſtleſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſant Tongues. Now Perſons of this temper will not want matter of Diſcourſe; and therefore pick up and ſpread abroad all ſorts of cenſures and reproaches againſt others, not ſo much out of Malice againſt them, as for their own Diverſion and eaſe, that their Tongues may not want Exerciſe. Take heed of this, it is in it ſelf a ſin, an abuſe of the Tongue, a waſting of time, a reproach to thy ſelf, it makes thee cheap and mean and contemptible in the eyes of others, and eſpecially of wiſe and good men, and it is alſo the cauſe of many other ſins.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Take heed of Pragmaticalneſs, which is, when Men are inquiſitive and buſie about other mens matters. A ſin often reproved in Scripture, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.11. <hi>For we hear that there are ſome walking among you diſorderly, working not at all.</hi> 1 Pet. 4.15. <hi>Let none of you ſuffer as an evil doer, or as a buſie body in other mens matters.</hi> You may obſerve how Chriſt reproveth this in his own dear Apoſtle, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.21, 22. Peter <hi>ſeeing him ſaith to Jeſus, Lord, and what ſhall this man do? Jeſus ſaith to him, if I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to thee? follow thou me:</hi> As if he had ſaid, mind you your own buſineſs, do not buſie your head about other men.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Take heed of man-pleaſing. There are many whoſe great imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and buſineſs it is to ſpread evil reports concerning others, who are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called Tale-bearers; and this they do to pleaſe the humours of Perſons with whom they converſe, unto whom they know ſuch Diſcourſe is moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable. And thus many Perſons make themſelves guilty in hearing reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es and not checking them, becauſe they will comply with the Company, they will not diſpleaſe nor offend their Friends. Take heed of this, and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that ſevere Sentence of the Apoſtle, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.10. <hi>If I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the Servant of Chriſt.</hi> He that pleaſeth other men, ſo as to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect any Duty, or to commit any ſin, whatſoever he pretends, he is not the Servant of Chriſt.</p>

And truly if this Rule were practiſed, ſome kinds of reproaches would be rare in the World: for Perſons of true and clear underſtanding are not apt to reproach others for different Opinions in leſſer matters; they conſider the weakneſs of humane Nature, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of mutual forbearance. It is the weaker ſort that are here, as in other things, moſt querulous; and generally where there is leaſt light there is moſt heat.

How many are there that are full of rage one againſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for being either for a Form of Prayer or againſt it, either for the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies or againſt them, that never ſearched into the ſtate of the Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and never took pains to examine the Arguments on both ſides, which in all reaſon they ought to have done, or elſe at leaſt to have reſtrained their Tongues from ſuch unreaſonable and ſinful cenſures and reproaches? Theſe, I ſay, are the Perſons that are moſt guilty, nay, upon the matter, the only guilty Perſons, except ſuch whom baſe Luſt and Intereſt doth corrupt and work to theſe animoſities.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Converſe much with your ſelves. It is want of buſineſs at home in mens own hearts, that makes them ramble ſo much abroad, and rake into the Lives of others. Study your ſelves more, and other men leſs. Did you ſearch your own hearts and lives, you would find ſo much cauſe of ſelf-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelf-abhorring, that you would have little cauſe to deſpiſe others, and much cauſe of compaſſion towards others.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Judg of others as you would do of your ſelves and your own Actions. It is worth our conſideration, what a great difference there is between the Judgment men paſs upon themſelves, and other men. As for themſelves, all their Errors are but ſmall miſtakes, and all their ſins againſt God, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever attended with ugly circumſtances of light, of conſent of the will, cuſtom, and allowance, yet they are but ſins of Infirmity, if themſelves may be Judges in their own Cauſe; Their injuries to men are but ſmall
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:95740:279"/> and trivial offences; and they do indeed expect both from God and Man a Pardon of courſe, which if they have not, they judg God tobe harſh and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere, Men to be cruel and implacable: But when they come to paſs Judgment upon other Men, the Tables are turned, ſome miſtakes are damnable deluſions, and all their ſins againſt God, which they can obſerve, are evidences of a naughty heart, and inconſiſtent with Grace, and the Offences of others againſt them are inexcuſable and intolerable, great affronts and Indignities: whereas on the contrary, thou ſhouldeſt, as it was ſaid of a great Man, <hi>Be ſevere to thy ſelf, and Candid to others:</hi> Becauſe thou knoweſt more wickedneſs by thy ſelf, and more aggravation of thy own ſins, than of all the ſins that are in the World. But at leaſt all the reaſon and Juſtice in the World requires this, that thou ſhouldeſt weigh thy ſelf and others in the ſame Balance, that thou ſhould<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt try thy own and their Actions by the ſame Touch-ſtone; and more need not be done. Thou who art ſo prone to flatter thy ſelf, wouldeſt certainly be more indulgent to other men, and paſs a more favourable conſtruction upon their Actions.</p>

            </p>
            <p>But the Explication of the <hi>Text</hi> is therein inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Son</hi> of Righteouſneſs, Jeſus Chriſt, who <hi>giveth Light to every one that cometh into the World (or coming into the World, giveth Light to all,)</hi> from his fulneſs hath beſpangled the Inferiour Heavens, his Church, with many fulgent <hi>Stars,</hi> appointed freely to communicate the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly light which they had freely received. In his corporal preſence he <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared</hi> them; and his Spirit having moved on the darkned World, he unreſiſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſaid, at the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Let there be Light, and there was Light;</hi> beginning at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but not fixed to any determinate place: But what he gave them, <hi>neceſſarily</hi> and <hi>antecedently,</hi> they were to Exerciſe as <hi>Free Agents,</hi> by a command more reſiſtable; which here he gives them. Having told them their <hi>Office,</hi> and given them their <hi>Names,</hi> v. 14. <hi>[Ye are the Lights of the World,]</hi> he next tells them how they muſt be uſeful. They muſt be conſpicuous, 1. Becauſe the Church where they are placed, <hi>is like a City on a Hill, which cannot be hid.</hi> 2. Becauſe it's the end of him that lighteth them and ſets them up, <hi>not to put them under a Buſhel, but on a Candleſtick, to give light to all his Houſe.</hi> And therefore no men's ſilencing or prohibitions, no difficulties or ſufferings will excuſe them from their Duty, <hi>Lights</hi> they are,
<pb n="546" facs="tcp:95740:280"/> and <hi>Shine</hi> they muſt: But leſt they ſhould think that it is Preaching only which he meaneth, he here commanding them their Duty, lets them know, that the ſplendour of Chriſtianity is in <hi>Works</hi> as well as <hi>Words:</hi> And thereby giveth us cauſe to think, that it is <hi>all his Diſciples</hi> or <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that he ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to, though <hi>firſt,</hi> and <hi>eminently,</hi> to the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and <hi>Teachers</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. By <hi>[Light]</hi> he meaneth both the <hi>Illuminating knowledg</hi> which muſt be uttered by <hi>Words;</hi> and the <hi>Splendour</hi> or <hi>Glory</hi> of <hi>Holineſs</hi> which muſt be refulgent in their Lives.</p>
            <p n="2">2. He calls it <hi>[Your]</hi> Light, as being <hi>their own</hi> in his <hi>Graces,</hi> as the <hi>Subjects,</hi> and their own in <hi>Exerciſe</hi> as the <hi>Actors;</hi> though both under him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It muſt <hi>[Shine,]</hi> that is, <hi>Appear in its ſplendour,</hi> for the Illumination and conviction of the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It muſt <hi>[So]</hi> ſhine, as is fitteſt to attain theſe ends: It is not every twinkling that will anſwer their great obligations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It muſt be <hi>[Before men;]</hi> that is, both thoſe within, and eſpecially thoſe without the Church, that are but <hi>Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. It muſt be a Light ſhining in <hi>[Good Works,]</hi> and their <hi>[Own] Works:</hi> For that is the grand difference between the Diſciples of Chriſt and others; He teacheth them not only to <hi>know</hi> and <hi>talk well,</hi> but to <hi>Do well:</hi> And he maketh men ſuch as he Teacheth them to be: <hi>Non magna loquimur ſed vivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tertullian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>[That Men may ſee]</hi> doth ſignifie both the neceſſary refulgent <hi>qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity</hi> of their Works, and alſo the <hi>end</hi> of God and them.</p>
            <p n="8">8. But it is not Hypocritical oſtentation of what they are not; nor of what they are and have, as for <hi>their own Glory,</hi> to be honoured and praiſed of Men: but for the Glorifying of God.</p>
            <p>Who is called <hi>[their Father]</hi> to ſhew their obligation to him, and to encourage them by the honour and comfort of their Relation, and to ſhew why <hi>their Works</hi> will tend to the glorifying of God; even becauſe they are ſo nearly related to him.</p>
            <p>And he is ſaid to be <hi>[in Heaven,]</hi> becauſe there he appeareth operatively in his Glory to the beautifying of Holy Spirits: As the Soul is ſaid to be in the Head; and we look a man in the face when we talk to him, as if there principally we ſaw the Man; becauſe it is in the Head that it operateth by Reaſon. So much of the meaning of the Words.</p>
            <p>Many Doctrines the Text affordeth us: as, <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Chriſt's Diſciples are the Lights of the World, both in the ſplendour of Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Holineſs.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Their moſt eminent and convincing ſplendour is in their good Works.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Their Light and good works are their own, though by the grace of Chriſt: And it is no injury to Chriſt, or his Righteouſneſs, or Grace, to ſay, that they are their own.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>The ſplendour of Chriſtians in their good Works muſt be ſuch as may be ſeen of Men.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. <hi>The Glorifying of God muſt be the end of our Good Works, and of their appearance unto men.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <pb n="547" facs="tcp:95740:280"/>
                  <item>6. <hi>As bad as corrupted Nature is there is yet ſomething in mankind which tendeth to the approving of the good works of Chriſtians, and to their glorifying God thereupon.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>7. <hi>God is glorified even by common men, when they approve of the Glory of Holineſs in Believers: It is not only by Saints that God is glorified.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>8. <hi>As contrary as Holineſs is to corrupted Nature, there is ſuch reſplendent goodneſs in true Chriſtians works, which common men may glorifie God for:</hi> And ſo ſomewhat in them, and in Chriſtianity, which hath ſuch agreeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as may tend to further good.</item>
                  <item>9. <hi>The Excellency and Splendour of the good works of Chriſtians, eſpecially Teachers, is a grand means, ordained by God himſelf for the Conviction of the World, and the glorifying of God.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But the reſolving the Queſtion, <hi>What the ſplendour of theſe works muſt be,</hi> is my preſent undertaken task.</p>
            <p>God is not glorified by our <hi>adding</hi> to him, but by our <hi>receiving</hi> from him; not by our making him greater, or better, or happier than he is, but by owning him, loving him, and declaring him as he is, that we and others may thereby be wiſe, and good, and happy.</p>
            <p>He is his <hi>own glory,</hi> and <hi>ours:</hi> And by his <hi>own light</hi> only we muſt <hi>know</hi> both <hi>him,</hi> and <hi>all things.</hi> We are not called to bring our <hi>Candle to ſhew</hi> the World that there is a Sun, but to perſwade them into <hi>its light,</hi> to open the Windows and Curtains, to diſperſe the Clouds, and to open the eyes of blinded ſinners.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The way of doing this, and glorifying God, is in the order following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing that <hi>our works</hi> muſt ſhew is their <hi>own goodneſs:</hi> They can never prove the Cauſe good, till it is clear, that they are <hi>good them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves:</hi> Therefore doubtleſs Chriſt here intendeth, that we muſt abound, eſpecially in <hi>thoſe good works</hi> which the world is capable of <hi>knowing to be good,</hi> and not only in thoſe which none but Chriſtians themſelves approve. If believers and unbelievers agreed in <hi>no common principles,</hi> we were not capable of preaching to unbelievers, nor convincing them, nor of conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them. There are many excellent things which Nature doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, and which both parties are agreed to be good: By the advantage of theſe, as <hi>granted principles,</hi> we muſt convince them of the <hi>concluſions,</hi> which they yet deny; and not, as the ſcandalous Chriſtian, ſo abſurdly <hi>affect ſingularity,</hi> as to make light of all good which is taken for good by unbelievers, and to ſeek for eminency in nothing, but what the World thinks evil. There is a glory in ſome good works, which all do honour, and which manifeſteth it ſelf.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And then the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>work</hi> doth manifeſt the <hi>goodneſs</hi> of the <hi>doer.</hi> Every man's work is ſo far his own, that he is related to it, and by it, either as laudable, or as culpable; as it is, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4, 5. <hi>Let every man prove his own work, and then ſhall he have rejoycing in himſelf alone, and not in another; for every man ſhall bear his own burthen. God</hi> himſelf will <hi>judge men according to their works;</hi> and ſo will <hi>men;</hi> and ſo muſt we (much) do by our ſelves; for it is the righteſt judging, which is likeſt God's.</p>
            <p>This ſubordinate honour God grants to his ſervants: If their <hi>works</hi>
               <pb n="548" facs="tcp:95740:281"/> were not an <hi>honour to them,</hi> as the <hi>next Agents,</hi> they could be none to him in their <hi>Morality,</hi> as <hi>man's acts;</hi> though they might, as acts in general, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to good by his own goodneſs. If God's Natural Works of Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (Sun, and Moon, and Earth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) were not praiſe-worthy in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, God would not be praiſed for them, as their Maker. There are works that God is ſaid to be diſhonoured by, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.23, 24. And what are they, but ſuch as are <hi>really bad,</hi> and a diſhonour to the <hi>Authors<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> It is ſo far from being true, that no praiſe, or honour, or comfort from good works is to be given to man, that <hi>God himſelf</hi> is not like elſe to be honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by them as morall good, if the Actors be not honoured by them: The World muſt firſt be convinced that <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are far <hi>better</hi> than <hi>other men,</hi> and the <hi>righteous more excellent than his Neighbour,</hi> before they will glorifie God as the Author of their goodneſs. In God's own Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment <hi>[Well done]</hi> is the firſt word, and <hi>[Good and Faithful Servant]</hi> is the ſecond, and <hi>[Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord]</hi> is the third.</p>
            <p>Two ſorts of Scandalous perſons rob God of his honour in his Saints.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe that profeſſing Chriſtianity, <hi>live wickedly,</hi> or at leaſt no better than other men; whoſe lives tell the World, that Chriſtians are but ſuch as they.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Thoſe that <hi>ſlander</hi> and <hi>belye</hi> true Believers, and would hide their goodneſs, and make them odious to the World.</p>
            <p>As for them that ſay only, that we have no <hi>righteouſneſs in our ſelvet by which we can be juſtified,</hi> I ſhall not differ with them, if they do but grant that <hi>all ſhall be judged according to their works;</hi> and that he that is accuſed as an Infidel, Impenitent, an Hypocrite, or an Unregenerate, Ungodly Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, muſt againſt that accuſation be juſtified by his own Faith, Repentance, Sincerity, and Holineſs, or be unjuſtified for ever.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The next thing to the <hi>Work</hi> and the <hi>Perſon</hi> that is hereby honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is the <hi>Chriſtian Religion it ſelf,</hi> with the <hi>Spirit's operations</hi> on the <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> The <hi>outward Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Example</hi> Of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his Servants to be better than the World; and the inward Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Spirit</hi> which <hi>maketh</hi> them better. The <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Food</hi> are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended which make men healthy, and the Medicines are praiſed which cure the diſeaſe: That is accounted good, as a means and cauſe, which <hi>doth good,</hi> and which maketh men good: If <hi>Chriſtians</hi> were more <hi>commonly</hi> and <hi>notoriouſly much better</hi> than all other men, the World would believe that the Goſpel, and the <hi>Chriſtian Religion,</hi> were the <hi>beſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But when ſcandalous Chriſtians appear as bad or worſe than Infidels, the World thinks that their Religion is as bad or worſe than theirs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The next aſcent of Honour is to the <hi>Maker</hi> or <hi>Author</hi> of our <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> the World will ſee that he is good that maketh ſo good a Law and Goſpel, and that maketh all his true Diſciples ſo much to excel all other men. And here the firſt honour will be to the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which reneweth Souls, and maketh them holy: And the next will be to the <hi>Son</hi> our <hi>Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> who giveth us both the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit:</hi> And the <hi>higheſt</hi> or <hi>ultimate Glory</hi> will be to God the Father, who giveth us both his Son, and his Spirit.</p>
            <pb n="549" facs="tcp:95740:281"/>
            <p>And thus Honour aſcendeth to the <hi>Higheſt</hi> by theſe ſteps, and the World beginneth at that which is <hi>neareſt to them,</hi> and Reaſon will proceed by theſe degrees: 1. The excellent <hi>holy lives</hi> of Chriſtians are better than other mens: 2. Therefore Chriſtians are better than other men: 3. Therefore their <hi>Religion</hi> is the beſt, or the <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Work</hi> which make them ſuch: 4. Therefore the Spirit is good which makes them good; the Saviour is good who giveth them that <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Spirit;</hi> and God the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all, even the Father of Mercies, Is the <hi>Fountain</hi> of all good, and conſequently the End of all. And thus God is <hi>known</hi> and <hi>glorified</hi> by our <hi>works.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>works</hi> which thus glorifie him, are <hi>firſt to be deſcribed in general,</hi> and <hi>then enumerated in ſpecial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. In General, 1. They muſt be ſuch as make, or ſhew men to be in their places <hi>like to God:</hi> They muſt be ſuch as repreſent the particular Perfections of God, which are called his Communicable Attributes; and ſuch as declare his <hi>Relations to us;</hi> and ſuch as declare his <hi>Attributes,</hi> as ſo <hi>related,</hi> and his <hi>works.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. They muſt be works of <hi>Holy Love</hi> to God and Man, which ſhew that God and Goodneſs have our hearts, and that we would imitate God in doing good to all according to our places and power, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.10, 11, 12.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They muſt be works of Life and Power, where <hi>ſerious diligence</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth zeal, and we ſet our ſelves no lower bounds, than with <hi>all our heart,</hi> and <hi>mind,</hi> and <hi>might,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. Thus much for the general deſcription of them.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The deſcription of a Chriſtian, whoſe <hi>works glorifie God,</hi> according to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Experience</hi> may be given you in the following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">I. He is one that placeth his ſaving Religion in the practical knowledge of the only <hi>true God,</hi> and <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the Saviour, whom he hath ſent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. He puts no <hi>limits</hi> to his endeavours after uſeful knowledge, but what God hath put by his Word or Providence: <hi>He would abound</hi> in holy <hi>wiſdom,</hi> and thinks it worth his greateſt diligence, and is ſtill upon the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing hand: He hath ſo much knowledge of the <hi>leſſer matters</hi> of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as to keep him from ſcandalous miſcarriages about them: but it is the knowledge of God, and of a <hi>crucified</hi> and <hi>glorified Chriſt,</hi> in which he taketh wiſdom to conſiſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. This is the <hi>Light</hi> in which he hath his <hi>daily converſation;</hi> the <hi>Light</hi> which <hi>governeth</hi> his <hi>will</hi> and <hi>pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice;</hi> which feedeth his Meditations, his prayers, and his diſcourſe; which repelleth his <hi>temptations;</hi> which maintaineth his hope; and is his daily work of Recreation, his Food, and Feaſt.</p>
            <p>For Men will now perceive, 1. That his Religion is not a matter of <hi>names</hi> and <hi>words,</hi> and trifling Controverſies, but hath the <hi>greateſt</hi> and <hi>moſt excellent</hi> Subject in the world: And as Nature teacheth all to reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence God, ſo it will tell them, that they muſt reverence that Religion, that Converſation, and that Perſon, who is moſt Divine, and where the moſt of God appeareth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And they will ſee that his Religion conſiſteth not in <hi>uncertainties,</hi> which no man can be ſure of, when he hath done his beſt; but in things ſo <hi>ſure</hi> as none ſhould doubt of: which will eaſily bring men over to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, and ſhame or ſilence Contradicters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And then they will ſee that it is a Religion which all <hi>ſober perſonr</hi> are <hi>united</hi> in, and doth not loſe its Authority, or Reverence, by the diviſions, wranglings, and digladiations of Sects of different minds; for God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied
<pb n="551" facs="tcp:95740:282"/> by no <hi>ſober man,</hi> nor the <hi>Eſſentials</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> by any <hi>true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. And men will ſee that our Religion is no matter of <hi>Indifferency,</hi> which one may do well enough without, but of abſolute neceſſity to Salvation, and that which man was <hi>made</hi> and <hi>redeemed</hi> for. And a Religion of the <hi>greateſt Subject,</hi> the <hi>greateſt Certainty,</hi> the <hi>greateſt Conſent,</hi> and the <hi>greateſt Neceſſity,</hi> will honour it ſelf, and its Author in the world, if it be rightly repreſented in the Lives of them that do profeſs it.</p>
            <p>But when mens <hi>over-doing</hi> ſhall pretend that all this is <hi>too little,</hi> and ſhall ſeek to raiſe it, as to <hi>more perfection,</hi> by their <hi>own Inventions,</hi> or <hi>uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Opinions</hi> in <hi>Doctrine, Worſhip, Church-Diſcipline,</hi> or <hi>Practice,</hi> they preſently caſt it as a Foot-ball before the Boys in the Streets, and make it a matter of doubtful endleſs <hi>Diſputations,</hi> of multiplied Sects, of perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious <hi>Contentions,</hi> and cruel Perſecutions: And then the Reverence and Glory of it is gone; and every Philoſopher will vie with it in ſubtilty, and every Stranger will preſume to cenſure it, if not to blaſpheme it, and deride it. And thus <hi>Over-doers</hi> are the <hi>Scandals</hi> of the World.</p>
            <p n="2">II. The Chriſtian that will glorifie God, and his Profeſſion, muſt be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcionable</hi> in the <hi>ſmalleſt matters;</hi> but he muſt ever <hi>deſcribe and open the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of his Religion, as conſiſting in great and certain things, and not talk too much of ſmaller matters, as if it were thoſe that men were to be ſaved by.</hi> Tell men of the neceſſity of believing, fearing, obeying, truſting, and lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God, and of coming to him by Jeſus Chriſt, the Great Mediator between God and Man: Tell them of the intrinſick evil of ſin, and of God's Juſtice, and of Man's Corruption, and of the Nature and Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of Holineſs, and of the neceſſity of being New-born of the Holy Spirit, and of mortifying the deſires and deeds of the Fleſh; and tell them of Judgment, Heaven, and Hell, eſpecially the certainty and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the everlaſting promiſed Glory; perſwade them to <hi>believe</hi> all this, to <hi>think</hi> much of all this, and to be <hi>true</hi> to what they <hi>know,</hi> and to make it the work of Life to be always prepared for Death. Let this be your diſcourſe with ſinners, (as I told you in the firſt Character, it muſt be your <hi>own Religion</hi>) and then men will perceive that Religion is a matter that doth indeed concern them, and that they are indeed great and neceſſary things, in which you differ from ungodly men: But the Scandalous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian talketh moſt of external Church-orders, and Forms, and Opinions, and Parties, and thereby maketh the ignorant believe, that the difference is but that one will <hi>ſit,</hi> when the other <hi>kneeleth;</hi> and one will pray by the <hi>Book,</hi> and the other <hi>without Book;</hi> and one is for this <hi>Church Government,</hi> and another for that; and one for praying in White, and the other in Black. And talking too much of ſuch things as theſe deceiveth the hearers: ſome it maketh formal hypocrites, who take up this for their Religion; and the reſt it hardeneth, and maketh them think, that ſuch people are only more humourous, and ſelf-conceited, and giddy, and factious than others, but no whit better.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Genuine Chriſtian hath an <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>cautelous underſtanding;</hi> ſenſible when he knoweth moſt, how little he knoweth, and how much he
<pb n="552" facs="tcp:95740:283"/> is ſtill unacquainted with, in the great myſterious matters of God. His Ignorance is his daily grief and burden, and he is ſtill longing and looking for ſome clearer Light: Not a new <hi>word</hi> of <hi>Revelation</hi> from God; but a clearer <hi>underſtanding</hi> of his Word. He knoweth how weak and ſlippery Man's underſtanding is, and he is humbly conſcious of the darkneſs of his own. Therefore he is not conceitedly wiſe, nor a boaſter of his know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; but ſaith, as <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.2. <hi>He that thinketh that he knoweth any thing,</hi> (that is, is proudly conceited of his own knowledge,) <hi>knoweth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing as he ought to know.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And hence it is that though he daily grow in the firmer apprehenſion of neceſſary Truths; yet he is never <hi>confident</hi> and <hi>peremptory</hi> about <hi>uncertain doubtful things:</hi> And therefore he is not apt to be <hi>Quarrelſome</hi> and <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious,</hi> nor yet <hi>cenſorious</hi> againſt thoſe that differ from him in matters of no greater moment. And hence it is, that he runneth not into Sects, nor burneth with the ſcaveriſh dividing Zeal, nor yet is ſcandalouſly mutable in his Opinions; becauſe, as one that is conſcious of his Ignorance, he doth not raſhly receive things which he underſtands not, but <hi>ſuſpendeth</hi> his <hi>judgment,</hi> till Evidence make him fit to Judge; and joyneth with neither of the contending Parties, till he is ſure or know indeed which of them is right. And thus he avoideth that diſhonouring of Religion, which the ſcandalous Chriſtian is wofully guilty of; who with an <hi>unhumbled under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding</hi> groweth confident upon <hi>quick and inſufficient</hi> information, and <hi>Judgeth</hi> before he <hi>underſtandeth</hi> the caſe, and before he hath <hi>heard</hi> or <hi>read,</hi> and <hi>conſidered</hi> what on both ſides may be ſaid, and what is neceſſary to a <hi>true underſtanding:</hi> And thus either by <hi>audacious prating</hi> of what he <hi>never underſtood,</hi> or <hi>reviling</hi> and <hi>cenſuring</hi> Men wiſer than himſelf, or by making himſelf a <hi>Judge</hi> where he hath need to be many years a <hi>Learner,</hi> or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a <hi>Religion of his own miſtakes,</hi> and ſetting up <hi>dividing Sects</hi> to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate them, or elſe by ſhameful <hi>mutability</hi> and <hi>unſettledneſs,</hi> he becometh a ſcandal to harden unbelievers, and a Diſeaſe to the Church, and a ſhame to his profeſſion; Read <hi>James</hi> 3. Conceited Wiſdom kindleth a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Zeal, and is not of God, but from beneath, v. 15.16, 17.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. The Chriſtian who <hi>Glorifieth God</hi> by his Religion, is one that ſo Liveth, that men may perceive that his <hi>carnal Intereſt is not the End and Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler of his Life;</hi> but that <hi>God is his End,</hi> and <hi>to pleaſe him is his Work, and his Reward,</hi> in which he is <hi>comforted,</hi> though the Fleſh and World be never ſo much diſpleaſed; And that the perfect <hi>Light and love of God</hi> in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeen Glory of another Life is the <hi>ſatisfying ſum</hi> of all his hopes, for which all the World muſt be forſaken. To <hi>talk</hi> much of Heaven, and to be as much and as eager for the World as others, is the way by which the ſcandalous Hypocrite doth bring Religion into Contempt. It is no high, nor very honourable Work, to <hi>talk</hi> of the <hi>vanity of the World,</hi> but to <hi>Live above</hi> it, and to be out of the <hi>power</hi> of it: Nor is it any great matter to <hi>ſpeak honourably of Heaven;</hi> but to Live as believing-ſeekers of it, and as thoſe that have there their Treaſure and their hearts, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.20, 21. and are comforted more by the <hi>Hopes</hi> of the Life to come, than by all their poſſeſſions or pleaſures in the World. If we will glorifie God,
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:95740:283"/> our Lives muſt perſwade Men, that he will certainly be our <hi>Everlaſting Portion,</hi> and the ſure and plentiful <hi>Rewarder of them that diligently ſeek him,</hi> Heb. 11.6. It is much of the uſe of a true Chriſtian's Life to convince Unbelievers that there is a <hi>Heaven</hi> for Saints; and the ſcandalous world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling perſwadeth them that there is none, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5, 11, 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.26, 21. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.1, 2, 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Therefore it Glorifieth God and our Religion, when Chriſtians <hi>Live in greater Joy,</hi> or at leaſt greater <hi>contentedneſs</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> than other Men: when they can anſwer all the Croſſes in the World ſufficiently with this, that <hi>God is their God,</hi> and his <hi>Love</hi> ſhall be their endleſs Joy, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.1. and 73.25, 26. And when they can <hi>Live</hi> by Faith, not by <hi>Sight,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. and <hi>can rejoyce</hi> in <hi>hope of the Glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.3, 5. and can <hi>comfort themſelves and one another with this,</hi> that <hi>they ſhall for ever be with the Lord,</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17, 18. and can truſt him to the Death, who hath ſaid, <hi>I will never fail thee, nor forſake thee,</hi> Heb. 13.5. If you would have other Men honour your God and your Religion, and deſire to be ſuch as you, you muſt really ſhew them that you are on <hi>ſafer grounds,</hi> and in a <hi>happier ſtate</hi> than they: And that you will hardly do, if you be not more <hi>comfortable</hi> than they, or at leaſt ſettled in more <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedneſs</hi> of mind, as thoſe that have a <hi>certain Cure</hi> for the <hi>fears</hi> of Death, and the danger that <hi>ungodly</hi> men are in, of the <hi>revenging Juſtice</hi> of the final Judge.</p>
            <p>I confeſs it's poſſible for trembling, troubled, and diſtreſſed Chriſtians to be ſaved: But O that they knew what a ſcandal they are to Unbelie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, and what a diſhonour to God whom their Lives ſhould Glorifie! What Man will fall in Love with <hi>Terrors, and unquietneſs of mind?</hi> If you would Glorifie God by your fears and tears, they muſt be ſuch as are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Faith and Hope; and you muſt not only ſhew men what would make you happy, if you could <hi>obtain it,</hi> but alſo that it is <hi>attainable. Happineſs</hi> is every Man's deſire, and none will come to Chriſt unleſs they believe that it tendeth to <hi>their Happineſs:</hi> They take up with the <hi>preſent pleaſures</hi> of the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> becauſe they have no ſatisfying apprehenſions of any <hi>better.</hi> And if no Man ſhew them the <hi>firſt-fruits</hi> of any <hi>better here,</hi> they will hardly believe that they may have better <hi>hereafter.</hi> It is too hard a talk to put a poor Drunkard, Fornicator, or a proud and Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous Worldling on to believe that a poor, complaining, comfortleſs Chriſtian is happier than he, and that ſo ſad and unquiet a Life muſt be preferred before all his temporal contentments and delights. You muſt ſhew him <hi>better,</hi> or the <hi>ſigns</hi> and <hi>fruits</hi> of <hi>better,</hi> before he will part with what he hath; You muſt ſhew him the <hi>bunch of Grapes,</hi> if you will have him go for the Land of Promiſe, when he is told of Gyants that muſt be overcome. And O what a bleſſing is reſerved for every <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> that encourage Souls, and glorifie the Promiſe! And how much do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected diſcouragers of ſinners diſhonour God and diſpleaſe him! I have known ſome ungodly Men, when they have ſeen believers rejoycing in God, and triumphantly paſſing through ſufferings in the joyful hopes of Glory, to ſigh and ſay, <hi>would I were ſuch a one,</hi> or <hi>in his caſe:</hi> But I have ſeldome heard any ſay ſo of a Perſon that is ſtill <hi>ſad,</hi> or <hi>crying,</hi> or <hi>troubling</hi>
               <pb n="554" facs="tcp:95740:284"/> themſelves and others with their Scruples, Croſſes, or Diſcontents; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be in reſpect to their blameleſs Living, perhaps <hi>condoling</hi> them they may ſay, Would I had no more ſin to trouble me than you have. I confeſs that ſome Excellent Chriſtians do ſhew no great mirth in the way of their Converſation; either becauſe they are of a grave and ſilent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, or taken up with ſevere Studies and Contemplations, or hindred by bodily pains or weakneſs: But yet their <hi>grave</hi> and <hi>ſober Comforts,</hi> their <hi>Peace</hi> of <hi>Conſcience</hi> and <hi>ſettled hopes,</hi> and <hi>truſt in God,</hi> delivering them from the terrors of Death and Hell, may convince an Unbeliever that this is a far better ſtate than the <hi>mirth</hi> and <hi>laughter</hi> of <hi>Fools</hi> in the <hi>Houſe of Feaſting,</hi> and in the vanities of a ſhort proſperity. The grave and ſolid Peace and Comfort of thoſe that have made their Calling and Election ſure, is more convincing, than a lighter kind of mirth, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.22.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. <hi>The Dominion of Love in the hearts of Chriſtians, appearing in all the courſe of their Lives, doth much Glorifie God and their Religion:</hi> I mean a <hi>common</hi> hearty Love to <hi>all men,</hi> and a <hi>ſpecial love</hi> to <hi>holy men,</hi> according to their various degrees of lovelineſs. Love is a thing ſo agreeable to right reaſon, and to ſociable Nature, and to the common Intereſt of all Mankind, that all Men commend it; and they that have it not <hi>for others,</hi> would have it <hi>from others:</hi> Who is it that loveth not to be loved? And who is it that loveth not the Man, that he is convinced <hi>loveth him,</hi> better than him that <hi>hateth him,</hi> or regardeth him not? And do you think that the ſame courſe, which maketh men <hi>hate your ſelves,</hi> is like to make them <hi>love your Religion?</hi> Love is the powerful Conquerer of the World: By it God conquereth the enmity of Man, and reconcileth to himſelf even ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant ſinners: And by it he hath taught us to conquer all the tribulations and perſecutions, by which the world would ſeparate us from his Love: Yea, and to be more than Conquerers through him that loved us, and thereby did kindle in us our reflecting love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.34, 35, 36. And by it he hath inſtructed us to go on to Conquer both his Enemies and our own; yea, to conquer the <hi>enmity</hi> rather than the <hi>Enemy,</hi> in imitation of himſelf, who <hi>ſaveth</hi> the <hi>ſinner,</hi> and <hi>kills</hi> the <hi>ſin:</hi> And this is the moſt noble kind of Victory. Every Souldier can end a Fever or other Diſeaſe by cutting a man's throat, and ending his Life: But it's the work of the Phyſitian to kill the Diſeaſe, and ſave the Man. The ſcandalous Paſtor is for Curing Hereſie in the <hi>Roman</hi> way, by ſilencing ſound Preachers, and tormenting and burning the ſuppoſed <hi>Hereticks:</hi> or at leaſt to truſt for the acceptance and ſucceſs of his Labours to the Sword: And if that which will reſtrain men from <hi>croſſing</hi> the <hi>Paſtor,</hi> would reſtrain them from <hi>reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſting</hi> the <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, and conſtrain them to the <hi>love of Holineſs,</hi> it were well: Then the glory of converſion ſhould be more aſcribed to the <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> and <hi>Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier</hi> than to the <hi>Preacher.</hi> But the true Paſtor is Armed with a <hi>ſpecial mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Life, Light, and Love,</hi> that he may be a meet Inſtrument for the Regenerating of Souls, who by holy <hi>Life,</hi> and <hi>Light,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> muſt be renewed to their Father's Image. Every thing Naturally <hi>generateth its like,</hi> which hath a generative power. And it is the <hi>Love of God</hi> which the Preacher is to bring all men to, that muſt be ſaved: This is his Office; this
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:95740:284"/> is his work, and this muſt be his ſtudy: He doth little or nothing if he doth not this. Souls are not ſanctified till they are wrought up to the <hi>Love of God and Holineſs.</hi> And therefore the <hi>Furniture</hi> and <hi>Arms</hi> which Chriſt hath left us in his Word, are all ſuited to this work of Love. We have the <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>God himſelf</hi> to Preach to them; and the love of an humbled, dying, and <hi>Glorified Redeemer;</hi> and all the amiable <hi>bleſſings</hi> of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> to open to them; and all the loving <hi>promiſes</hi> and invitations of the Goſpel: And muſt not our <hi>Hearts,</hi> our Miniſtry, and our <hi>Lives</hi> be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to all this? Believe it, it muſt be a Preacher, whoſe <hi>matter</hi> and <hi>manner</hi> of <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Living</hi> doth ſhew forth a hearty <hi>Love to God,</hi> and <hi>Love to Godlineſs,</hi> and <hi>Love to all his Peoples Souls,</hi> that is the fit Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to glorifie God by convincing and converting ſinners. God <hi>can work</hi> by what means he will; by a ſcandalous, domineering, ſelf-ſeeking Preacher, but it is not his ordinary way. <hi>Foxes</hi> and <hi>Wolves</hi> are not Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture's Inſtruments to generate <hi>ſheep.</hi> I never knew much good done to Souls by any Paſtors, but ſuch as Preached and Lived in the <hi>Power of Love, working</hi> by clear <hi>convincing Light,</hi> and both managed by a <hi>holy, lively ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> You muſt <hi>bring fire,</hi> if you would <hi>kindle fire.</hi> Truſt not here to the <hi>Carteſian</hi> Philoſophy, that meer motion will turn another Element in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to fire. Speak as <hi>loud</hi> as you will, and make as great a ſtir as you will, it will be all in vain to win mens <hi>Love</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> till their hearts be touched with <hi>his Love</hi> and <hi>Amiableneſs;</hi> which uſually muſt be done by the Inſtrumentality of the <hi>Preacher's Love. Let them hate me, ſo they do but fear me and obey me,</hi> is the ſaying of ſuch as ſet up for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, (and but fooliſhly for themſelves,) and like Satan would Rule Men to damnation. If Love be the ſum and fulfilling of the Law, Love muſt be the ſum and fulfilling of our Miniſtry. But yet by <hi>Love</hi> I mean not <hi>Flattery;</hi> Parents do love as <hi>neceſſarily</hi> as any, and yet muſt <hi>Correct:</hi> And God himſelf can love and yet Correct: Yea, he chaſteneth every Son that he receiveth, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6, 7. And his Love conſiſteth with <hi>pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal juſtice,</hi> and with hatred of ſin, and plain and ſharp reproof of ſinners: And ſo muſt ours; but all, as the various operations of <hi>Love,</hi> as the objects vary.</p>
            <p>And what I ſay of Miniſters, I ſay of every <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in his place. Love is the great and the <hi>new</hi> Commandment, (that is, the laſt which Chriſt would leave at his departure to his Diſciples.) O could we learn of the Lord of Love, and Him, who calleth himſelf <hi>LOVE it ſelf, to love our Enemies, to bleſs them that curſe us,</hi> and to do <hi>good</hi> to the <hi>Evil,</hi> and <hi>pray</hi> for them that <hi>hurt</hi> and <hi>perſecute us,</hi> we ſhould not only prove that we are genuine Chriſtians, the Children of our Heavenly Father, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 5.44, 45.) but ſhould heap coals of fire on our Enemies heads, and melt them into Compaſſion and ſome remorſe, if not into an holy Love. I tell you, it is the Chriſtian, who doth truly love his Neighbour as himſelf; who loveth the Godly as his Co-heirs of Heaven, and loveth the ungodly with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to make them truly Godly; who loveth a Friend as a Friend, and an Enemy as a <hi>Man</hi> that is capable of Holineſs and Salvation. It is he that Liveth, walketh, ſpeaketh, converſeth, (yea, <hi>ſuffereth,</hi> which is the

            <p>It is a point that our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> layeth a great ſtreſs upon: He purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly healeth on the Sabbath day; and tells the cenſorious Phariſees, <hi>The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath;</hi> that is, <hi>the end,</hi> which is man's good, is to be preferred before the <hi>means;</hi> nay, it is no <hi>means,</hi> and ſo no <hi>duty,</hi> which is againſt it.

To omit a Sacrament, to break the Reſt of the Lord's day, to forbear the Sacred Aſſemblies, may be a duty, when the <hi>good of men</hi> requireth them. <hi>Ordination</hi> is a duty, when it is a <hi>means</hi> to its proper end: But if it were pleaded againſt thoſe <hi>ends,</hi> and <hi>order</hi> ſet againſt the <hi>thing ordered,</hi> even the work of the Miniſtry, the caſe would be altered.</p>
            <p>When men miſtake, and miſ-time, and miſ-place God's Inſtitutions, to the excluding of the great Moral duties which are their end, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade men to that as a part of Religion, which would certainly do more hurt than good, they ſcandalouſly drive men away from Religion. Thus imprudent ſcandalous Profeſſors can <hi>backbite</hi> and reproach others, and make them odious, and deſtroy Chriſtian Love, and Peace, and Concord, on pretence of Zeal for Order, Government, Ceremonies, Forms, or for this or that Mode of Diſcipline or Worſhip; not having learned what this meaneth, <hi>I will have Mercy, and not Sacrifice,</hi> nor, that Forms and External Inſtitutions were made for man, and not man for them. And yet I know, that this will not juſtifie the Familiſt, or Hypocrite, who thinks that he may do any thing to ſave his fleſh.</p>
            <p>Do you think it is not a ſcandal to <hi>Turks,</hi> or other Infidels, tempting them to deride, or hate Chriſtianity, to find the Papiſts placing their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in hurtful Pilgrimages, which waſte that time which ſhould be ſpent, and in a multitude of unprofitable Ceremonies, and in unwholeſome food and injuries to health, under the Names of Abſtinence and Mortification? By this Rule they may next perſwade us, that it will pleaſe God, if men famiſh, or hang themſelves; and conſequently, if they do ſo by others: For we muſt love our Neighbour but as our ſelves. God himſelf hath made all our Religion ſo ſuitable to <hi>our good,</hi> that he expecteth not that we ſhould take any thing for <hi>our duty,</hi> but what he giveth us Evidence in the thing, or <hi>ſecurity by his promiſe,</hi> ſhall be our gain. He that worketh upon ſelf-love, and winneth man by a Saviour, and a <hi>glorious reward,</hi> and proveth the goodneſs of all his Word and ways, as to our happineſs, hath inſtituted none of his Ordinances to our hurt. The Apoſtles had
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:95740:287"/> their <hi>power</hi> only to <hi>Edification,</hi> and not the Deſtruction, or hurt of Souls, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.8. and 13.10. <hi>Let all things be done to Edifying,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.26, is a word of greater comprehenſion and uſe, than many do conceive: When it is againſt Edification, it is not acceptable to God. One would think Chriſt had broken his own Law of Diſcipline, when he did familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eat with Publicans and Sinners: And yet that very Act of his, is one of thoſe which he juſtifieth by the aforeſaid Rule, I will have Mercy and not Sacrifice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.11, 12, 13. Learn this Leſſon of preferring Mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Sacrifice, if ever you will glorifie God.</p>
            <p>The <hi>right manner of Worſhipping God</hi> is of great moment to the Honour of him and of our Religion before the World: That we give no <hi>falſe deſcriptions of God,</hi> or <hi>diſhonourable attributes:</hi> That we teach no diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Doctrine as his; eſpecially of his own <hi>Will and Counſels,</hi> and of his <hi>Government, Laws,</hi> and <hi>Judgment:</hi> That we neither take down the Glory of the Goſpel Myſteries by reducing them to the rank of Common Providence, nor yet be deceived by Satan or his Miniſters, as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters of Light and Righteouſneſs, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.15. to abuſe and diſhonour them by <hi>over-doing:</hi> That we ſeek not to glorifie God by our lyes, or by our own miſtaken Interpretations or inventions. God muſt be Worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped as a Spirit in Spirit and Truth, and not with Popiſh toyes and fop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peries; which make others think, that our Religion is but like a Poppet-Play and ludicrous device, to keep the People in Servitude to the Prieſts by a blind Devotion: God muſt be Worſhipped <hi>Rationally,</hi> and with all holy <hi>wiſdom;</hi> and not with Childiſh ſhadows and trifles, nor with ſloven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and <hi>imprudent words,</hi> which tend to breed in the hearers deriſion or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt: Neither the cantings or ſcenical Actions, or affected Repetitions of the Papiſts, nor the rude, diſorderly, incongruous Expreſſions of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilful men, are fit to be offered to the Glorious God: <hi>Prudence,</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Seriouſneſs,</hi> and <hi>Reverence</hi> muſt appear in that Worſhip which muſt honour God.

Nor to be <hi>more Learned,</hi> or <hi>Wiſe,</hi> or <hi>Pious</hi> than <hi>he is.</hi> We muſt be indeed <hi>his Diſciples,</hi> who <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf,</hi> and <hi>made himſelf of no Reputation,</hi> Phil. 2.7, 8. and waſhed and wiped the feet of his Diſciples, to teach them what to be, and do to one another; who hath taught us the neceſſity of <hi>Croſs-bearing,</hi> and ſelf-denial, and to <hi>humble our ſelves as little Children,</hi> if ever we will enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. and 18.3, 4. and hath decreed and fore-told us, that <hi>whoſoever ſhall exalt himſelf,</hi> ſhall be abaſed; and <hi>he that humbleth himſelf ſhall be exalted;</hi> and therefore the <hi>greatneſs</hi> which his Miniſters muſt ſeek, muſt be to be the Servants of the reſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.11, 12, 13. <hi>Honour ſhall uphold the humble in ſpirit,</hi> Prov. 29.23. <hi>But a man's Pride ſhall bring him low. Better is it to be of an humble ſpirit with the lowly, than to divide the ſpoyls with the Proud,</hi> Prov. 16.10. He that will honour his Religion, muſt <hi>put on as the Elect of God, bowels of mercy, kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humbleneſs of mind</hi> (not of Tongue only) <hi>meekneſs, long-ſuffering forbearing one another, and forgiving one another, if any man have a Quarrel againſt any,</hi> Col. 3.12, 13. He muſt not ſet out himſelf like the <hi>Richeſt,</hi> and deſire to ſeem <hi>high</hi> or notable to others, nor ſet up himſelf with his Superiours, nor ſwell or grudge if he be not regarded or taken notice of; no, nor if he be reproved or diſhonoured: But muſt <hi>learn</hi> of an humbled Chriſt to be <hi>meek and lowly,</hi> Mat. 11.29. and muſt not <hi>mind</hi> (or deſire) <hi>high things;</hi> but <hi>condeſcend to men of low eſtate, and not be wiſe in his own conceit,</hi> Rom. 12.16. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, that you walk worthy the vocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherewith ye are called, with all lowlineſs and meekneſs,</hi> with <hi>long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, forbearing one another in Love,</hi> Eph. 4.1, 2. <hi>Let nothing be done through ſtrife, or vain glory, but in lowlineſs of mind let each eſteem others better than themſelves,</hi> Phil. 2.3. What man loveth not ſuch a Spirit and Converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? O that it were more common and eminent among us, and then we ſhould find that the diſ-affection of the Ignorant, would be much abated, and that, when a man's wayes thus pleaſe God, his Enemies will be (the more) at peace with him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.7. But when <hi>they are proud,</hi> and <hi>we are proud,</hi> and we cannot <hi>yield</hi> nor bow, nor give place to the wrathful, but muſt juſtle and contend with them for our place and honour, we loſe our Chriſtian honour by ſeeking Carnal honour, and appear to be but like other men: And even the Proud themſelves will diſdain the Proud.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And though we may be <hi>Angry</hi> and not <hi>ſin,</hi> and muſt be <hi>plain</hi> and <hi>zealous</hi> againſt ſin and for God, though guilty galled ſinners be diſpleaſed by it; yet meekneſs muſt be our temperature: For a <hi>turbulent, rough, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiet ſpirit,</hi> is diſpleaſing both to God and Man; ſuch Perſons have ſeldom
<pb n="563" facs="tcp:95740:288"/> peace with others or themſelves. A meek and quiet ſpirit <hi>is in the ſight of God of great price,</hi> 1 Pet. 3.4. Bleſſed are the meek for they ſhall <hi>Inherit</hi> the Earth; they ſhall ſpeed better than others, even in this World, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.5. <hi>The Wiſdom from above is firſt pure, then peaceable, gentle, eaſie to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated, full of mercy and good fruits. Paul</hi> tells us what the good works are, which we muſt be <hi>alwayes ready to. To ſpeak evil of no man, to be no brawlers; but gentle, ſhewing all meekneſs to all men,</hi> Tit. 3.1, 2. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaks more of this than I have leiſure to recite: See <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.23. and 6.1. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11. and 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.4. and 76.9. and 147.6. and 37.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And <hi>Patience</hi> both towards God and Man is a neceſſary Companion of <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>Meekneſs.</hi> This greatly differeth from <hi>Natural dulneſs,</hi> and an <hi>inſenſible</hi> temperature. When a man's Soul is partly ſo much awed by God's Authority and Preſence; and partly ſo much taken up with the great matters of his Service; and partly ſo much contented with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and grace and the hopes of glory, as to make light of all the Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts of the Fleſh as ſuch, and therefore to bear patiently ſuch loſſes and croſſes, and wants, and ſufferings, as touch the Fleſh, as taking it for no great matter to loſe all the World, if we ſave our Souls; this is true Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, by which God is glorified: For by this men will ſee that Chriſtians have indeed ſuch great things in their hopes, as ſet them quite above the tranſitory things of the Fleſh and World. But when they are much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at every Croſs and Loſs; and whine and complain as if they were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, if they live in Poverty or Reproach; and are at their wit's end in every danger; and fret and ſtorm at every ill word, or every one that wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them; they are the ſhame of their Profeſſion, and ſcandals to the World. It is not a <hi>ſudden Anger</hi> which is the great ſin of <hi>Impatience;</hi> but an impotent diſability to ſuffer in the Fleſh, in Eſtate or Name, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining under every want, which ſheweth a Fleſhly Worldly mind, and a want of true believing the heavenly Felicity: Though I confeſs that Pity muſt make ſome Excuſe for many poor Women, whoſe Natural temper maketh their Paſſions troubles and fears invincible. He that ſaid, <hi>In your Patience poſſeſs your ſouls,</hi> doth intimate, that we have loſt our ſelves and the government, order, and Peace of our Souls, when we have loſt our Patience, <hi>Luke</hi> 21.19. See <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.7, 8. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Be patient towards all men,</hi> 1 Tim. 6.11. Col. 1.11. Whatever Zeal you ſeem to have in Prayer, in Preaching, and for purity of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, if you can bear <hi>wants</hi> and <hi>ſickneſs,</hi> and the <hi>loſs of all the World</hi> no better than others, you will appear no better in their Eyes; for <hi>if you faint in the day of Adverſity your ſtrength is ſmall,</hi> Prov. 20.10.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. And as a ſpecial <hi>fruit</hi> of <hi>Humility,</hi> An <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>thankful bearing of Reproof, and readineſs to confeſs a fault upon due conviction,</hi> is a neceſſary duty to the Honouring of God. It will ſhew men that you are Enemies to ſin indeed, and that you are not Hypocrites, who weed only their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours Fields, and ſee the Mote in another's Eye, and not the Beam which is in your own. <hi>If the Righteous ſmite us by Reproofs, it muſt be taken as a kindneſs, and as a precious Balſome which doth not break our Head, but heal us,</hi>
               <pb n="564" facs="tcp:95740:289"/> Pſal. 141.5. Not that we are bound to belye our ſelves in compliance with every man's cenſorious humour that will accuſe us; but we muſt be readier to cenſure our ſelves than others, and readier to confeſs a fault, than to expect a confeſſion from others whom we Reprove. <hi>Sincerity</hi> and ſerious <hi>Repentance</hi> will be honourable in that Perſon, who is moſt careful to avoid ſin, and moſt ready penitently to confeſs it when he hath been overcome, and truly thankful to thoſe that call him to Repentance; as being more deſirous that <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> have the glory of <hi>their Holineſs,</hi> than that he himſelf ſhould have the <hi>undue glory of Innocency,</hi> and eſcape the deſerved ſhame of his ſin.</p>
            <p>It is one of the moſt dangerous Diſeaſes of Profeſſors and greateſt ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals of this Age, that Perſons taken for eminently Religious are more impatient of plain (though juſt) reproof, than many a Drunkard, Swear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or Fornicator: And when they have ſpent hours or dayes in the ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing earneſt Confeſſion of their ſin, and lament before God and Man, that they cannot do it with more grief, and tears; yet they take it for a hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous injury in another, that will ſay half ſo much againſt them, and take him for a malignant Enemy of the godly, who will call them as they call themſelves. They look that the chief buſineſs of a Preacher ſhould be to <hi>praiſe them,</hi> and <hi>ſet them above the reſt,</hi> as the only People of God; and they take him for an Enemy that will tell them the truth. But the ſcandal is greateſt in thoſe Preachers themſelves, who cannot endure to hear that they are ſinners: So tender and impatient of Reproof are ſome, yea, ſome that for their Learning, and Preaching, and Piety, are ranked in the higheſt form, or expect to be ſo, that almoſt nothing but flattery or praiſe can pleaſe them; and they can hardly bear the gentleſt Reproof, no, nor a contradiction of any of their Opinions: But they ſeem to tell men that it is their part and priviledge to be the Reprovers of others, and to have no Reprover; and to tell other men of ſin, and be themſelves accounted In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent; and to call other men to Repentance for Particular ſins, while they themſelves muſt have no other Repentance, than in general to ſay that they a ſinners; and to proclaim to all that their Publick Confeſſions are formalities, and that it is a Chriſt to heal the Souls of others that they Preach, while they acknowledge but little work for his remedies on them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. But he that <hi>refuſeth reproof doth err, and he that hateth it is brutiſh,</hi> how Learned, or Reverend, or Pious ſoever he would be accounted, <hi>Prov.</hi> 11.17. and 12.1. <hi>He that regardeth reproof is prudent, and he that hateth it ſhall die,</hi> Prov. 15.5, 10. As ready humble penitent confeſſion of ſin doth tend to our Pardon from God; ſo doth it tend to our acceptation with Man: When God and Man will condemn the Phariſee, that juſtifies him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf till Confeſſion be extorted from him.</p>
            <p n="13">XIII. It is another very Honourable fruit of Humility to have a <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſition,</hi> and not to be <hi>Magiſterial;</hi> and to be <hi>ſwift to hear,</hi> and <hi>ſl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>w to ſpeak.</hi> All Chriſt's Diſciples muſt be as <hi>little Children, Matth.</hi> 18.3, 4. eſpecially in a learning, <hi>teachable</hi> diſpoſition. A Child doth not uſe to ſet his wit againſt his Maſter's, or any other that will teach him, nor to riſe up againſt inſtruction, as a Diſputer that muſt have the better,
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:95740:289"/> and be accounted the wiſeſt; but his daily buſineſs is <hi>ſubmiſſively</hi> to <hi>learn.</hi> A Genuine Chriſtian is indeed communicative, and willing that others ſhould partake with him in the wiſdom and happineſs which God hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed to him: But he is ready firſt to learn himſelf, and knoweth that he muſt <hi>receive</hi> before he can <hi>communicate:</hi> And there is none ſo far below him, but he is willing to hear and learn of; but eſpecially among his Equals he is readier to <hi>hear</hi> and <hi>learn,</hi> than to <hi>teach,</hi> becauſe he is ſtill con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of his ignorance, and honoureth the gifts of God in others, which the proud deſpiſe, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.1. and 1.19.</p>
            <p>But the ſcandalous Chriſtian is ſo wiſe in his own eyes, that he is ever of a <hi>teaching humour,</hi> and thoſe pleaſe him beſt that will ſit and hear, and reverence him as an Oracle, and magnifie every word that drops from his lips: He is ſo full of <hi>himſelf,</hi> that he hath ſcarce the patience to obſerve well what another ſpeaks or writeth; and ſo valueth his own Conceptions, that he thinks they ſhould be valued by the hearers: And ſo ſcandalous is the teaching humour of ſome Learned men, that they have not the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good manners or civility to ſuffer another to ſpeak to the end, but they muſt needs interrupt him, that <hi>they</hi> may ſpeak, as being <hi>more worthy:</hi> They take other mens ſpeeches to be ſo tedious, that their patience cannot hold out the length of them: I mean not, that a Wiſe man is bound to loſe his time in hearing every ſelf-conceited perſon talk; but when men are engaged in Conference or Diſputes, for a man to have ſuch liſt to ſpeak, that he cannot ſtay till another (though long) come to the end, it is ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous incivility; yea, ſome can ſcarce ſtay till two or three Sentences be uttered, but their haſte muſt tell you, that they take themſelves to be much the Wiſer, and to be fitter to teach, than to hear and learn: And they are ſo over-loaden with their own conceited wiſdom, that they can carry it no longer without ſome vent; and ſo full of their own, that they have no room to receive any more from others: And being all Maſters, they receive from God and Man the greater Condemnation, <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.1. <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.17. and 1.5. and 18.13.</p>
            <p n="14">XIV. The Genuine Chriſtian hateth <hi>backbiting,</hi> and <hi>diſgraceful reports of others,</hi> and <hi>yet can bear it from others to himſelf.</hi> He hath learned to <hi>love all,</hi> and to <hi>ſpeak evil of no man,</hi> nor to <hi>receive</hi> or vend <hi>ill reports of others.</hi> He knoweth that this is the work of the Devil, the mortal Enemy of Love. He modeſtly <hi>rebuketh the backbiting tongue,</hi> and <hi>with an angry countenance driveth it away,</hi> Pſal. 15.3. Tit. 3.2. Prov. 25.23. <hi>Backbiters</hi> tell us that they are <hi>haters of men:</hi> And the Apoſtle joyns them with <hi>haters of God,</hi> Rom. 1.30. <hi>Debates, backbitings, whiſperings, envyings,</hi> are the ſcandalous Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian's work, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.20. He that heareth them, will either <hi>diſtaſte them,</hi> or <hi>catch</hi> the diſeaſe, and be as bad as they: And he that heareth that he is calumniated or reproached by them behind his back, is tempted to abhor both them and their Profeſſion. But to deal with men as faithful Friends, and in plainneſs (but with prudence and love) to tell them ſecretly of their defects and faults, this tendeth to good, and to reconcile the minds of men at laſt, and to the honour of the Chriſtian way, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16. <hi>Levit.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.8. and 24.25. and 27.5. <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.5. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.23.</p>
            <pb n="566" facs="tcp:95740:290"/>
            <p>But yet when we are belyed and reproached our ſelves, though by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, or Teachers, or Superiours, it beſeemeth us not to make too great a matter of it, as being tender of our own Reputation; but only to be ſorry for the ſlanderer's or backbiter's ſin and miſery. For mens corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on will have vent; the angry, and malicious, and envious, will ſpeak from the abundance of their hearts; and the guilty will be tender; and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren will cry and quarrel; and proud Contenders will be impatient: And how ſmall a matter is it, as to us, to be Judged of Man, who muſt all be ſhortly Judged of the Lord?</p>
            <p n="15">XV. He is one that would <hi>keep open to the notice of all, the great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the Godly, and the Wicked;</hi> and <hi>aſpireth after the higheſt degrees of Holineſs,</hi> as knowing the <hi>corruptions</hi> and <hi>calamities of the weak,</hi> and how much of Heaven is in Holineſs it ſelf; and yet <hi>he loveth, honoureth, and cheriſheth the leaſt ſpark of Grace in the weakeſt Chriſtian; and is none of them that conſoriouſly deſpiſe ſuch, nor that tyrannically tread them down, or caſt them injuriouſly out of the Church.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. To make men believe that there is little difference between the holy and the profane, is to bring all Religion into contempt, and is a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs which God's Laws throughout condemn, and his Judgment ſhall publickly confute, <hi>Matth.</hi> 3.18. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.6. to 11. <hi>Jude</hi> 15. <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.25. throughout.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To take up with a <hi>little goodneſs,</hi> which conſiſteth with ſcandalous cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, is to be a ſcandal in the Church.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And yet to be ſupercilious, and to diſdain the weak, or ſhut out any as ungodly, whom Chriſt hath not warranted us to ſhut out, and to make ſtricter Rules of Tryal and Church-Communion than he hath made, this is juſtly diſpleaſing both to God and Man: It tempteth men to abhor that Religion, which tendeth more to mens reproach than to their cure, and cauſeth Profeſſors to ſet themſelves higher above the weak, and at a greater diſtance from their Neighbours, than God would have them. Chriſt is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of little ones, and would not have them ſcandalized: His own Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were very low in knowledge all the time that he was with them on Earth. It is not mere want of words, that will warrant us to take men for ungodly; even he that is <hi>weak in the Faith muſt be receiv'd, but not to doubtful diſputations,</hi> Rom. 14.15. To Cull out a few that have learnt to ſpeak better than the reſt, and ſhut out, with the Dogs, all the Infant-Chriſtians who muſt be <hi>fed with Milk,</hi> becauſe they want expreſſions, is one of Satan's wayes of over-doing, by which he would baniſh Religion out of the World.</p>
            <p n="16">XVI. He that will glorifie God by his <hi>good works,</hi> muſt be <hi>zealous</hi> and <hi>diligent</hi> in them, and <hi>make them the ſerious buſineſs of his life:</hi> He muſt live ſo, that men may ſee, that indeed he doth believe, and hope for Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. That which a man <hi>coldly ſpeaks of,</hi> and <hi>coldly ſeeketh,</hi> men will think he <hi>coldly deſireth;</hi> and therefore that he doth but <hi>doubtingly believe it.</hi> A cold ſlothful Chriſtian proclaims <hi>his unbelief</hi> to others, and ſo inviteth them <hi>to the like.</hi> When Chriſtians beſtir themſelves, as for their lives, and ply God's work with greateſt diligence, and redeem their lives, as
<pb n="567" facs="tcp:95740:290"/> knowing that all is ſhort enough to prepare for an endleſs life; this wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keneth others to life and thoughtfulneſs, to enquire into the matter of our hopes.</p>
            <p n="17">XVII. He that will glorifie God muſt be <hi>wiſe</hi> and <hi>watchful,</hi> to ſee and take the <hi>opportunities of good before they are paſt by,</hi> and to <hi>avoid temptations</hi> to <hi>errour</hi> and <hi>iniquity,</hi> and <hi>eſpecially Temerity in matters of great and publiek conſequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Good works</hi> have their <hi>ſeaſon:</hi> You loſe them, if you take them not in their time; that may be done now, which, if you paſs this time, you can never do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Temptations alſo have their ſeaſon, and muſt <hi>juſt then</hi> be reſiſted, leſt many a year repair not an hours loſs. And they are very many: And narrow-ſighted careleſs perſons, who avoid two, and fall into the third, or avoid nineteen, and are conquered by the twentieth, are always ſcandalous.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And <hi>raſh adventures</hi> on any <hi>Opinions</hi> or <hi>actions,</hi> but eſpecially of publick conſequence, are uſually moſt ſcandalous and pernicious to the Church. As in Military Affairs, and in Phyſick, <hi>ubi non licet bis errare,</hi> mens lives muſt pay for our temerity and errour, and all the World can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not remedy the effects of <hi>one miſtake:</hi> So in matters of <hi>Religion,</hi> if we miſtake by our raſh conceitedneſs, and take not <hi>time</hi> for <hi>neceſſary tryal,</hi> and proceed not as a man on the Ice, or among Quick-ſands, with great care and deliberation; the ſhaking of Kingdoms, the ruine of Churches, the ſilencing of Miniſters, the corruption of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Diſcipline, and the ſin and damnation of many Souls, may be the effect of our proud preſumption and temerity: But the humble, ſelf-ſuſpecting man, that <hi>ſuſpendeth</hi> his <hi>judgment</hi> and <hi>practice,</hi> till he hath throughly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all, doth preſerve the honour of Religion, and avoid ſuch late and dear repentance.</p>
            <p n="18">XVIII. The man whoſe works ſhall glorifie God, muſt be <hi>devoted to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Concord of Believers,</hi> and be <hi>greatly averſe to dividing and love-killing Opinions, words, and practices,</hi> and <hi>as much as in him lies, he muſt live peaceably with all men,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.10. Phil. 2.1, 2, 3. Eph. 4.3, 4, 14, 15, 16. Rom. 16.17. and 12.18. 1 Theſ. 5.17. Joh. 17.24. When <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Dividers ſerve not the Lord Jeſus, but their own bellies,</hi> he intimateth to us, that though Truth and Purity be in their mouths, and really <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended</hi> by them, as they take it; yet there is uſually a ſecret ſelf-intereſt that is carried on, that byaſſeth the judgment: And when he telleth them, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.30. that <hi>of their own ſelves ſhould men ariſe, ſpeaking perverſe things,</hi> which they called (and it's like believed to be) the Truth; yet ſelf-intereſt lay at the bottom, to be ſome-body in drawing <hi>Diſciples after them:</hi> For it is ſo notorious a truth, that Unity and Concord are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably neceſſary to the Church, as it is to our Body, to Families, to Kingdoms; that men could not do ſo deſtructive a thing as <hi>dividing</hi> is, if ſome ſin had not firſt cauſed the errour of their minds. It greatly ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noureth Chriſt and Religion in the world, when Believers live in love and unity: And their diſcords and diviſions have in all Ages been the ſcandal
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:95740:291"/> of the World, and the great reproach and diſhonour of the Church. When Chriſt's Diſciples are <hi>one in him,</hi> it is the way to the Infidel-world's Converſion, that they may <hi>believe that the Father ſent him,</hi> Joh. 17.24.</p>
            <p>And here the Devil hath two ſorts of ſervants: 1. The true <hi>Schiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> or <hi>Heretick,</hi> who fearleſly and blindly divideth the Churches. 2.

            <p>And when ſuch a <hi>Holy will</hi> and <hi>contentment appeareth</hi> in you, mankind will reverence it, and ſee that your Natures are Divine; and as they dare not reproach the Will of God, ſo they will fear to ſpeak evil of yours: When they ſee that you chuſe but what <hi>God firſt</hi> chuſeth for you, and <hi>your wills</hi> do but follow the <hi>Will of God,</hi> men will be afraid of provoking God againſt them as blaſphemers, if they ſhould ſcorn, deride, or vilifie you. And could we convince all men that our courſe is but the ſame which <hi>God commandeth,</hi> it would do much to ſtop their reproach and perſecution: And if they ſee that we can joyfully ſuffer reproach, or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty, or pains, or death, and joyfully paſs away to God, when he ſhall call us, and live and die in a <hi>contented complacency</hi> in the <hi>Will of God,</hi> they will ſee that you have a beginning of Heaven on Earth, which no Tyrant, no loſs, or croſs, or ſuffering, can deprive you of, while you can joyfully ſay, The Will of the Lord be done, <hi>Act.</hi> 21.14.</p>

            <p>When the Houſes of Chriſtians are Societies of Saints, and Churches of God, and live in love and concord together, and all are laborious and faithful in their Callings, abhorring idleneſs, gluttony, drunkenneſs, pride, contention, and evil ſpeaking, and dealing juſtly with all their Neighbours, and denying their own right for love and peace; this is the way to glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie Religion in the world.</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>Well ordered Churches</hi> are the ſecond ſort of Societies, which muſt glorifie God, and propagate Religion in the world.</p>

            <p>When Miniſters are above all wordly intereſt, and ſo teach and live, that the people may ſee that they ſeek not the <hi>honour which is of men,</hi> but only that <hi>which is of God,</hi> and <hi>lay not up a treaſure on Earth, but in Heaven,</hi> and trade all for another world, and are further from <hi>pride,</hi> than the loweſt of their ſtock: when they have not only the <hi>cloathing of ſheep,</hi> but their <hi>harmleſs profitable nature,</hi> and not the ravenouſneſs or bloudy jaws of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Wolves: when they uſe not <hi>carnal weapons</hi> in their warfare, but by an <hi>eminency</hi> of <hi>light,</hi> and <hi>love,</hi> and <hi>life,</hi> endeavour to work the ſame in others: when they are of more <hi>publick ſpirits</hi> than the people, and more <hi>ſelf-denying,</hi> and above all <hi>private intereſts,</hi> and envyings, and revenge, and are more patient in ſuffering than the people, through the power of ſtronger Faith, and Hope, and Love: when they are wholly addicted to holineſs and peace, and are zealous for the Love and Unity of Believers, and become all things to all men to win ſome; in <hi>meekneſs inſtructing oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers,</hi> abhorring contention, <hi>doing nothing in ſtrife or vain-glory,</hi> but <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring others before themſelves;</hi> not preaching Chriſt in <hi>pride or envy,</hi> nor ſeeking their own praiſe, but thirſting after mens converſion, edification, and ſalvation. Thus muſt Chriſt be honoured by his Miniſters in the world.</p>
            <p>When they <hi>ſpeak the ſame things,</hi> being of one <hi>mind and judgement,</hi> uniting in the <hi>common Faith,</hi> and contending for that againſt Infidels and Hereticks, and ſo far <hi>as they have attained walk by the ſame rule, and mind the ſame things;</hi> and where they are differently minded or opinioned, wait in meekneſs and love till God reveal to them reconciling truth: when they ſtudy more to <hi>narrow Controverſies,</hi> than to <hi>widen</hi> them, and are <hi>skilful</hi> in detecting thoſe <hi>ambiguous</hi> words, and <hi>verbal</hi> and <hi>notional differences,</hi> which to the unskilful ſeem <hi>material:</hi> when they are as <hi>Surgeons,</hi> and not as Souldiers, as skilful to <hi>heal</hi> differences, as the <hi>proud</hi> and <hi>ignorant</hi> are ready to <hi>make</hi> them, and can plainly ſhew the dark Contenders, <hi>wherein they agree and do not know it:</hi> when they live in that ſweet and amicable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, which may tell the world that they love one another, and are of one Faith and Heart, being one in Chriſt. This is the way for Miniſters to glorifie God in the world. And with thankfulneſs to God I acknowledge, that ſuch for many years I had my converſation with, of whom the world that now deſpiſeth them is not worthy. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.21. <hi>Matth.</hi> 6.19, 20, 21. <hi>John</hi> 5.44. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.25, 26. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.19, 20, 22. and 10.33. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3, 4. <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.14, 15, 16. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.14, 24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.

            <p>And the maintaining of ſound Doctrine, Spiritual, Reaſonable, and Reverent Worſhip, without ludicrous and unreverent trifling, or rude<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Ignorance, or Superſtition, or needleſs ſingularity, much honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth God, (as is aforeſaid.) And ſo doth the Exerciſe of <hi>Holy Diſcipline</hi> in the Churches: Such Diſcipline whereby the <hi>precious</hi> may be <hi>ſeparated</hi> from the <hi>vile,</hi> and the <hi>holy</hi> from the <hi>profane,</hi> by <hi>Authority</hi> and <hi>Order,</hi> and not by popular uſurpation, diſorder, or unjuſt preſumptions: Where the cauſe is <hi>fairly tryed</hi> and <hi>judged,</hi> before men are caſt out, or denyed the priviledges of the Church: Where <hi>Charity</hi> appears in <hi>embracing</hi> the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt,</hi> and turning away none that turn not away from Chriſt, and condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing none without juſt proof: And <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>holineſs</hi> appeareth in purging out the <hi>dangerous leaven,</hi> and in <hi>trying</hi> and <hi>rejecting</hi> the <hi>obſtinately impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Heretick,</hi> and <hi>groſs ſinner</hi> after the <hi>firſt</hi> and <hi>ſecond admonition,</hi> and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owning them that will not hear the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. When the neglect of Diſcipline doth leave the Church as polluted a Society as the Infidel World, and Chriſtians that are owned in the publick Communion are as vitious, ſenſual and ungodly as Heathens and <hi>Mahometans,</hi> it is one of the greateſt injuries to Chriſt and our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World: For it is by the <hi>purifying of a peculiar people, zealous of good works,</hi> that Chriſt is known to be really the Saviour of the World; and by making his followers better than others, that he and his Doctrine and Religion are known to be the beſt. Travellers tell me that nothing ſo much hindreth the converſion of the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as their daily Experience that the Lives of the Greek Chriſtians, and others that Live among them, are too ordinarily worſe than theirs. More drunkenneſs, and more falſhood, lying, deceit, it's ſaid, are among thoſe Chriſtians than among the Turks. If that be true, thoſe are no true Chriſtians; but woe be to them, by whom ſuch offence cometh. I have oft heard thoſe Souldiers juſtly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured as profane, who turn Churches into Stables (without great neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity:) But how much more hurtfully profane are they, who for <hi>carnal ends</hi> confound the <hi>World</hi> and the Church; and keep the multitude of the moſt ſenſual ungodly Perſons in their Communion, without ever calling them Perſonally to Repentance; and uſe the Church Keys but to revenge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on thoſe that differ from them in ſome Opinions, or that croſs their Intereſt and wills, or that ſeem too ſmart and zealous in the diſlike of their Carnality, Sloth, and Church-pollutions? When the <hi>Churches</hi> are as full of <hi>ſcandalous ſinners</hi> as the Aſſemblies of <hi>Infidels</hi> and <hi>Heathens,</hi> the World will hardly ever believe that <hi>Infidelity</hi> and <hi>Heatheniſm</hi> is not as good as the <hi>Chriſtian Faith.</hi> It is more by <hi>Perſons</hi> than by <hi>Precepts,</hi> that the World will judge of Chriſt and Chriſtianity. And what Men on Earth do more ſcandalize the World, more expoſe Chriſtianity to reproach, more harden Infidels, more injure Chriſt, and ſerve the Devil, than they that fill the Church with <hi>impious Carnal Paſtors</hi> (as in the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>) and then with <hi>impious Carnal People,</hi> maintained conſtantly in her Communion, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any open diſowning by a diſtinguiſhing, reforming Diſcipline? When
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:95740:294"/> ſuch Paſtors are no better than the ſoberer ſort of Heathens, ſave only in their <hi>Opinion</hi> and <hi>formal words,</hi> and when their ordinary Communicants are no better, it's no thanks to them, if all turn not Infidels that know them, and if Chriſtianity be contemned and decay out of the World: And it's long of ſuch, that <hi>diſorderly ſeparations</hi> attempt that Diſcipline and diſtinguiſhing of the godly and the notoriouſly wicked, which ſuch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly Paſtors will not attempt: See <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15, 16. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10. <hi>Jer.</hi> 15.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 15. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.17. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.4, 5.</p>

But O how great an honour is it to God and to Religion, when <hi>Kings, Princes,</hi> and <hi>States</hi> do zealouſly devote their Power to God, from whom they do receive it, and labour to make their Kingdoms Holy! When Truth, Sobriety, and Piety have the countenance of humane pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and Rulers wholly ſet themſelves to further the faithful Preaching and practiſing of the Holy Faith, and to Unite and ſtrengthen the Miniſters and Churches, and to ſuppreſs Iniquity, and be a terror to evil doers, it taketh Satan's great advantage out of his hand, and worketh on carnal Men by ſuch means as they can feel and underſtand. Not that God needs the help of Man, but that he hath ſetled Officers and a Natural Order, by which he uſually worketh in the World. And as it cannot be expected that an unholy Parent and Maſter ſhould have a Holy Family, or an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy Paſtor a Holy Church, unleſs by extraordinary Mercy; no more can we expect that ungodly Magiſtrates ſhould have a godly Kingdom or Common-wealth; of which the Sacred Hiſtory of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Iſraeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh</hi> Kings doth give you a full confirmation: But this I muſt now ſay no more of.

            <p>Let us briefly now apply it.</p>
            <p>This informs us what an <hi>honourable ſtate</hi> Chriſtianity and true Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <label type="milestone">

            <p>And what wonder if all the <hi>Powers of darkneſs</hi> do bend their endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>2</label> to obſcure this Sacred Light? The <hi>Prince of darkneſs</hi> is the Enemy of the <hi>Father of Lights:</hi> And this is the great war between Chriſt and Satan in the world, Chriſt is the <hi>Light of the World,</hi> and ſetteth up Miniſterial Lights for the world, and for his Houſe; his work is to ſend them forth, to teach them, and defend them, and to ſend his Spirit to work in and by them, to bring Men to the everlaſting Light: And Satan's work is to ſtir up all that he can againſt them, high and low, learned and unlearned, and to put Chriſt's Lights (both Miniſters and People) under a buſhel, and to make the world believe that they are their Enemies and come to hurt them, that they may be hated as the Scorn and off-ſcouring of the world, and to keep up Ignorance in Miniſters themſelves, that the Churches Eyes being dark, the darkneſs may be great.</p>
            <p>But let us pray that God would <hi>forgive our Enemies, Perſecutors, and Slanderers, and turn their hearts;</hi> and that he would <hi>open our Lips, that our mouths may ſhew forth his praiſe;</hi> and though his Miniſters and People have their faulty weakneſſes, that he would <hi>be merciful to our Infirmities, and grant that thoſe things, which the craft and ſubtilty of the Devil, or Man worketh againſt us, may be brought to nought, and by the providence of his goodneſs may be diſperſed; that we his Servants being hindred by no perſecution, may give thanks to him in his holy Church, and ſerve him in holineſs and pureneſs of life, to his Glory,</hi> through Jeſus Chriſt. <label type="milestone">

Your Lives</hi> muſt teach men to believe that there is a <hi>Heaven</hi> to be won, and a <hi>Hell</hi> to be eſcaped: <hi>Your Lives</hi> muſt help Men to believe that <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>his Word</hi> are true: <hi>Your Lives</hi> muſt tell Men what <hi>Holineſs</hi> is, and convince them of the need of <hi>Rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration,</hi> and that the <hi>Spirit of Sanctification</hi> is no fancy, but the witneſs of Jeſus Chriſt in the world: <hi>Your Lives</hi> muſt tell Men by Repentance and Obedience that ſin is the <hi>greateſt Evil;</hi> and muſt ſhew them the difference between the <hi>Righteous</hi> and the <hi>Wicked:</hi> Yea, the <hi>Holineſs of God</hi> muſt be Glorified by <hi>Your Lives.</hi> Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, the Scripture, the Church, and Heaven it ſelf, muſt be known much by <hi>our Lives.</hi> And may not I ſay then with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. <hi>What manner of Perſons then ought we to be in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs,</hi> when <hi>the Grace of God, which bringeth Salvation hath appeared to all Men, teaching us to deny ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, and to live ſoberly, righteouſly, and godly in this preſent world?</hi> Tit. 2.11, 12.</p>

Will the world turn Chriſtians by ſeeing Chriſtians ſeek the blood and ruine of each other? And hearing even Preachers Reproach each other? Or ſeeing them ſilence, or perſecute each other? Or by ſeeing the People run into many Sects, and ſeparate from one <hi>another,</hi> as unworthy of Chriſtian Communion? Will Proud, Ignorant, Cenſorious, Fleſhly, Worldly Profeſſors of Religion, ever draw the World to love Religion? Or will peeviſh, ſelf-willed,

Alas! what wonder that ſo ſmall a part of the world are Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and ſo few converted to the love of Holineſs, when the Great Means is denied them by you, which God hath appointed for their Converſion, and the world hath not one Helper for a hundred or thouſand that it ſhould have? You cry out of thoſe that put out the Church-lights under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſnuffing them, while your ſelves are Darkneſs, or as a ſtinking Snuff.</p>
            <p>O Brethren, and Chriſtians all, I beſeech you let us now, and often, cloſely ask our ſelves, What do we more than an <hi>Antonine,</hi> a <hi>Seneca,</hi> or a <hi>Cicero,</hi> or a <hi>Socrates</hi> did, beyond opinions, words, and formalities? What do you which is like to convert the world, to convince an Infidel, or glorifie God? Nay, do not ſome among us think that it is the height (or part) of their Religion, to live ſo contrary to the world, as to be <hi>ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> from others, even in lawful or indifferent things, and to do little or nothing which the world thinks well of? As if <hi>croſſing</hi> and <hi>diſpleaſing</hi> men <hi>needleſly</hi> were their <hi>winning converſation.</hi> O when once we go as far be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond them in <hi>love, humility, meekneſs, patience, fruitfulneſs, mortification, ſelf-denial,</hi> and <hi>heavenlineſs,</hi> as we do in <hi>opinions, profeſſion,</hi> and <hi>ſelf-eſteem;</hi> then we ſhall win Souls, and glorifie God, and he will alſo glorifie us.</p>
            <p>And here we ſee the wonderful mercy of God to the World, who <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>6</label> hath appointed them ſo much means for their Conviction and Salvation: So many Chriſtians as there be in the World, ſo many Practical Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and helps to mens Converſion are there appointed by God. And let the blame and ſhame lye on us, where it is due, and not on God, if yet the World remain in darkneſs. It is <hi>God's Will</hi> that <hi>every Chriſtian</hi> in the <hi>World</hi> ſhould be as a Star, to ſhine to ſinners in their darkneſs; and O then how gloriouſly would the World be beſpangled and enlightned! If you ſay, <hi>Why then doth not God make Chriſtians better?</hi> That is a queſtion which cannot be well anſwered without a larger opening of the Methods of Grace, than we can now have leaſure for; and therefore muſt be don<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> its proper ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>Thoſe that honour God he will honour; and therefore let us alſo give <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe </seg>7</label> them that honour which is their due. The barren Profeſſors, who honour themſelves by over-valuing their poor knowledge, gifts, and grace, and affecting too great a diſtance from their Brethren, and cenſuring others as unworthy of their Communion without proof, are not the men that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour God, and can lay claim to no great honour from men: But God hath among us a prudent, holy, humble, laborious, patient Miniſtry, that glorifie him by their works and patience; and he hath among us a meek and humble, a blameleſs, and a loving, and fruitful ſort of Chriſtians, who imitate the Purity, Charity, and Simplicity, yea, and Concord of the Primitive Church: Theſe tell the World to their ſight and experience, that Religion is better than Ignorance and Carnality: Theſe tell the World, that Chriſt and his Holy Word are true, while he doth that in
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:95740:296"/> renewing and ſanctifying Souls, which none elſe in the World can do. Theſe ſhew the World, that Faith, and Holineſs, and Self-denial, and the hopes of Immortality, are no deceits: Theſe glorifie God, and are the great Benefactors of the World. I muſt ſolemnly profeſs, that did I not know ſuch a people in the world, who (notwithſtanding their infirmities) do manifeſt a holy and heavenly diſpoſition in their lives, I ſhould want my ſelf ſo great a help to my Faith in Chriſt, and the promiſe of Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that, I fear, without it my Faith would fail. And had I never known a holier Miniſtry and People than thoſe that live but a <hi>common life,</hi> and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel Heathens in nothing but their <hi>Belief</hi> or <hi>Opinions,</hi> and <hi>Church orders</hi> and <hi>Formalities,</hi> I ſhould find my Faith aſſaulted with ſo great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as, I doubt, I ſhould not well withſtand. No talk will perſwade men, that he is the beſt Phyſitian that healeth no <hi>more</hi> nor <hi>worſe</hi> diſeaſes than others do: Nor would <hi>Chriſt</hi> be taken for the <hi>Saviour</hi> of the World, if he did not ſave men: And he ſaveth them not, if he make them not <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier</hi> and <hi>better</hi> than other men.</p>
            <p>O then how much do we owe to Chriſt for ſending <hi>his Spirit</hi> into his Saints, and for <hi>exemplifying</hi> his holy Word on <hi>holy Souls,</hi> and for giving us as many <hi>viſible proofs</hi> of his <hi>Holineſs, Power,</hi> and <hi>Truth,</hi> as there are <hi>Holy Chriſtians</hi> in the world! we muſt not flatter them, nor excuſe their faults, nor puff them up: But becauſe the Righteous is more excellent than his Neighbour, we muſt accordingly <hi>love and honour</hi> them, and <hi>Chriſt</hi> in them: For Chriſt telleth us, that <hi>he is glorified in them here,</hi> Joh. 17.10. And that what is <hi>done to them,</hi> his <hi>Brethren,</hi> even the <hi>leaſt,</hi> is taken as <hi>done to him,</hi> Mat. 25.

            <p>All thanks are due to God the Father, who is the Father of Chriſt, and in him our God and Father; and therefore this work is to be done only in, by, and through Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.20. giving thanks always for all things unto God, and the Father, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. All glory be given by the Church to Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, 15. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 16.27. How this great Duty is to be performed to God through Chriſt Jeſus. 3. Praiſes and Thankſgivings are the great duty of our lives; for if we do all things in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt, then whatever we do in his Name is ſpecial matter of Thankſgiving. In every thing give thanks: if we think a good thought, or do a good work, it is of God; and therefore be thankful, and it is a Sacrifice to be tendered to God every day, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. As to the firſt Doctrine, conſider 1. What it is to do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 2. Why we muſt do all in that Name. 3. How ſhall we come to do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. 4. Some Uſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. What is it to do all in the Name of Chriſt? 1. It is to go to him as a Mediator, or to go to God by him: For we muſt upon all occaſions go to God in a way of prayer by Chriſt, if we will be accepted, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.2. God's Spirit tells us, that he is a God hearing prayer; therefore unto him ſhall all fleſh come and appear: Not come to God in prayer, but by Chriſt as Mediator. <hi>Beza</hi> ſets it out, <hi>Invocato Chriſti Nomine,</hi> we muſt go to God; <hi>quod autem addit</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>diligenter notandum eſt, ut ſciamus Deum fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtra coli niſi Chriſtus Mediator interveniat.</hi> We muſt go to God (by him) we muſt take ſpecial notice of that word, for we do in vain make our Addreſſes to God, but by the interceſſion of our Mediator. All our Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications are to be put in the Name of Chriſt, as he bids us, <hi>John</hi> 15.3, 16. and <hi>John</hi> 16.23, 26. he tells them, whatſoever they ſhould ask the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:95740:297"/> in his Name at that day (<hi>i. e.</hi> after his Aſcenſion, and giving the Spirit) you ſhall ask in my Name; and I ſay not unto you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He ſpeaks this by way of encouragement unto them, that they ſhould go in his Name, and then they ſhould certainly ſpeed: He gives as loving Friends ſometimes do, when they certainly intend to do ſome ſpecial good for a Friend; they ſay, I will not tell you what I'l do for you, intimating thereby they will do what they can for them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is to do all by his Authority, Power, and Command, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.18, 19, 20. Chriſt tells them, <hi>that whatever they did bind or looſe on Earth in his Name, (i. e.</hi> by his Authority and Command) <hi>ſhould be bound in Heaven: For when two or three are gathered together in his Name, (i. e.</hi> by vertue of his Command) <hi>he would be in the midſt of them. All Power and Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity is given of the Father to Chriſt,</hi> Mat. 28.18, 19, 20. and therefore go in the Name of the Father, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Laws and Proclamations, which go forth in the Name of the King, they go forth in his Authority. All our actions come under his Command, he is our King and our Law-giver, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.22. Though other Lords beſides Chriſt have had Dominion over us, but by him only will we make mention of his Name, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.13. By vertue of his Command and Authority we'll make mention of thy Name, we will admire and praiſe thee. He is a Soveraign Lord who Commands, and doth impoſe Laws on the Conſciences of men; his Laws reach the inward as well as the outward man, elſe all that we do cannot be done in his Name, and by vertue of ſome Authority from him, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, <hi>Rev.</hi> 19.16. and the only Potentate, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is to do all in his ſtrength and power, this is to do all in his Name. Thus <hi>Acts</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiaphas,</hi> &amp;c. asked <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> by what Power, or by what Name they had done this, <hi>v.</hi> 10. <hi>Peter</hi> told them that in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt did that Man ſtand whole before them: thus did they come in the Power of Chriſt. To go about a work in the Name of Chriſt is to go about it and do it in his ſtrength and Power, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45. <hi>David</hi> went againſt <hi>Goliah</hi> in the Name of the Lord of Hoſts; ſo <hi>David</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 108.10, 11. <hi>that in the Name of the Lord he would deſtroy them,</hi> i. e. in the ſtrength and Power of the Lord. <hi>Paul</hi> can do all things through Chriſt who ſtrengthens him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. <hi>His Grace was ſufficient for him,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.9. <hi>No man in the ſtrength of his own parts or gifts can do any thing ſo as to be accepted,</hi> John 15.5. <hi>(without me ye can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing)</hi> he doth not ſay, that you may do ſomething, or that you can do but little, but <hi>you can do nothing without me.</hi> He worketh all our works for us, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. even the will and the deed, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. Paul <hi>laboured more abundantly than they all,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.10. but he preſently corrected himſelf, <hi>Yet not I, but the Grace of God which was with me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. For his Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. So that as he is the Author, ſo he is the end of all we do, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. <hi>All people muſt honour the Son, as they honour the Father,</hi> Joh. 5.23. <hi>Chriſt is the</hi> Alpha <hi>and</hi> Omega <hi>of all,</hi> Rev. 1.8. <hi>All Glory and Honour is due to Chriſt, as is due to the Father,</hi> Rev. 4.9, 11. <hi>they give glory to him that ſits on the Throne,</hi> and <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.12, 13. <hi>there is all honour given to him that ſitteth on the Throne, and to the Lamb,</hi> they which do all for the glory of God, do all their actions to the honour of God the
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:95740:298"/> Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, ſo that when God doth any thing for us, he doth it for his Name's ſake; and therefore when <hi>David</hi> begged of God, that for his Name's ſake he would lead him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.3. he means, for his Glory, we ſhould have an eye at the Glory of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="5">5. To do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, is to live a life of Faith for a ſupply of all things for Life and Godlineſs, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3. he tells us, <hi>we have all things,</hi> that is, we that have like precious Faith, ſpoken of in <hi>v.</hi> 1. and that Live in the Exerciſe of it upon Chriſt, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. This Faith in Chriſt's Name being Exerciſed in a way of Prayer is the way to obtain whatever we ask, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. Every Believer doth live a life of Faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.33. In all conditions, and at all times, in the whole courſe of his Life: ſo that what <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid of the healing of the Cripple, may in a ſort be ſaid of a Believer in the courſe of his Life, by Faith in Chriſt's Name he does all.</p>
            <p n="6">6. To do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus, it is to walk in the Religion of the Lord Jeſus, according to his Rule, for Doctrine, Worſhip, and Practice of Life, <hi>Micah</hi> 4.5. The People of God do ſay, <hi>we will walk in the Name of the Lord our God.</hi> The Heathens did own and honour the Names of their gods, eſpecially in the Religion, Worſhip, and Inſtitutions of their gods: and ſo the People of God that walk in the Name of the Lord Jeſus keep cloſe to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. <hi>He that nameth the Name of Chriſt muſt depart from Iniquity.</hi> It is on this account that the Servants of Chriſt are hated and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.22. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.17. for his Religion which they Profeſſed, ſo <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.3. they are ſaid for his Name's ſake to have laboured, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 13. to hold faſt his Name, and <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.8. not to deny his Name.</p>
            <p>All People joyn in Communion with their God and one another that truſt in the Name of their God, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42, 43. The Primitive Chriſtians did walk and continue in the Apoſtles Doctrine and Fellowſhip, and they about the Throne at the Sea of Ordinances appointed by Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.2. worſhipping of him in a way of viſible Communion with all ſuch as are joyned to the God of <hi>Abraham, Pſal.</hi> 47.9. All that walk in the Name of Chriſt walk in all the ways and Ordinances of Chriſt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 8.6. In all his ways, <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.22. and in no other, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19, 20. obſerve all things which I command you.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is to follow his Example. The Examples of Perſons, who have had great Names in the World, have prevailed much for doing and ſuffering. All ſuch as are profeſſedly the Diſciples of Chriſt, his Name is upon them in a ſpecial manner, and therefore they ſhould follow his Example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.24. <hi>And follow me.</hi> We muſt walk as Chriſt walked, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.6. We muſt follow his Example, for his Life was Exemplary, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21, 22, 23. He preſſeth his own Example, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.29. for meekneſs and lowlineſs, and <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.15. <hi>I have given you an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that you ſhould do as I have done to you.</hi> It was an Example of the greateſt condeſcenſion in the eleven Offices of Love, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.25. Husbands have Chriſt propounded as an Example of Love to their Wives; Perſons of Eminency and Dignity have great Names, and carry many followers, and many walk accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their Example, and upon that account are called by their Names: for Examples prevail more than Precepts.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing propoſed, was the reaſons why we muſt do all in the Name of Chriſt. 1. Becauſe all we have, are, or can do, is of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. All Grace and ſtrength to us is from him, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. So that he is a Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever's
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:95740:298"/> 
               <hi>all and in all,</hi> Col. 3.11. All that God gives to us is through him, and by him only, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, &amp;c. Adoption is by him, <hi>v.</hi> 5. the Seal of the Spirit, and the earneſt of our Inheritance is by him, <hi>v.</hi> 13, 14. We are created to good works in him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. Reconciliation and Peace is by him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.18. All our actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſupplyes are by him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.19. His Grace is exceeding abundant in him, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14, 15. For he is a Super-excellent Perſon, and hath the preheminence above all things, a Name above every Name; in him all things ſubſiſt, in him all fulneſs dwels, as the Apoſtle ſhews, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.16, 17, 18, 19. and therefore it pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Father that we ſhould receive all Grace for Grace through him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Father hath exalted Chriſt, and given him a Name above every Name, that he who was ſo much deſpiſed and rejected, and whoſe Name was a Reproach and Scorn to all, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.2, 3, &amp;c. that Name ſo much abaſed, the Father hath appointed that it ſhall be exalted above every Name, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.8, 9, 10. and all other names ſhall vaniſh, and be as nothing before this Name, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. there being no other Name in Heaven or in Earth by which we ſhall be ſaved; therefore all muſt honour the Son as they honour the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.23. Upon this account all People ſhall be beholding to him for all the good that ever they do, or have, or are.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Becauſe we cannot be accepted either as to our Perſons or performances, but by him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.6. accepted in the beloved, in him alone he is well pleaſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.17. ſo that all that goes to God from us is by his hand, it muſt be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented by his hand, and perfumed with his Incenſe, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3, 4. <hi>Abel</hi>'s Sacrifice found acceptation by faith in the Meſſiah, when he preſented it to God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.4. We have our Lord Chriſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.6. in the midſt of the Throne, to nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate between him that ſits upon the Throne, and the Saints that are about the Throne; ſo that nothing comes from Heaven to us in a way of Bleſſing, but what comes through his hand, and nothing goes from us to Heaven in a way of Duty ſo as to be accepted, but only by his hand, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. So that his Name is the only prevailing Name with God, he having ſatisfied the Juſtice of God, pacified the wrath of God, and removed the Curſe of God from us; ſo that all Sacrifices whatever, that find the way to Heaven and find acceptance there, muſt of neceſſity be in his Name, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.1.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Becauſe all that comes from God to us muſt be by his hand, he is the <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi>'s Ladder, ſpoken of, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.12. God acts towards us as a God in a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace and Peace with us only in Chriſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.20, 21. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. and therefore the Apoſtolical Benedictions and Prayers for Grace, Mercy, and Peace, are from God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.2, 3. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2, 3. He calls them Elect, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by God the Father, through Sanctification of the Spirit, and blood of Jeſus, <hi>v.</hi> 3. We are ſaid to be bleſſed by the Father and begotten, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through Chriſt; and therefore ſince God doth act as a God of all Grace and Peace, we muſt do all in his Name, by which the Father is propitiated toward us, he being made ſin for us, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. and a Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.</p>
            <p>But here comes in a Queſt. How they can be ſaid to do any thing in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that are not one with him, though yet they pretend to do all in his Name, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.22, 23. but are not owned by him.</p>
            <p>I Anſwer, It is one thing to pretend to do a thing in the Name of Chriſt, another thing to do it indeed; that is, by true Faith in his Name, by which they are made one with him.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="584" facs="tcp:95740:299"/>2. There was in that Age a Faith of Miracles, which though it were an Extraordinary gift, and common both to Believers and Reprobates, they might be ſaid to do thoſe great things in Chriſt's Name; that is, by a Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er derived from him, though they were not in Chriſt, neither did own him as their Saviour, nor were owned by him.</p>
            <p n="3">

What is done properly in his Name in the ſence of the Text muſt take into its compaſs all the foregoing particulars mentioned, elſe it will not be accepted, it muſt be done in the Name of Chriſt as Mediator: Many things may be done in the Name of Chriſt, even Mountains may be removed, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2. and yet not be done by Faith in his Name, as has been ſaid. The third thing propounded was, <hi>how we may come to do all in the Name of our Lord Jeſus,</hi> and this may be inſtead of a Uſe of Direction to us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We muſt be ſuppoſed to be in Chriſt before we can do any thing in Chriſt's Name, according to that in <hi>John</hi> 15.4, 5. where he tells us, <hi>that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we abide in him,</hi> (that ſuppoſeth that they are in him firſt) <hi>we can do nothing, v.</hi> 5. for he compares our being in him to that of a Branch in the Vine, which cannot bear Fruit of it ſelf unleſs it abide in the Vine. <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> enquiring into the reaſon why ſo many ordinary things done by the Saints are ſet down in Scripture with a mark of Honour upon them, and yet the moral vertues and famous deeds of the great Philoſophers and others are paſſed by, Anſwers, that the reaſon is, becauſe their Perſons are not in Chriſt, and therefore their actions are not accepted, and ſaith, <hi>Si vel</hi> Cicero, <hi>vel</hi> Socrates <hi>ſanguinem ſudaſſet, tamen propterea non placeret Deo,</hi> If <hi>Socrates</hi> or <hi>Cicero</hi> had ſweat drops of blood, their actions had not pleaſed God. <hi>Coment. in Gen.</hi> 29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Suppoſing we are one with Chriſt, we muſt Exerciſe Faith upon him, and have conſtant recourſe to him in all that ever we do, for the ſupplyes of his Grace and Spirit, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.20. By Faith reſigning all to him, caſting all our burdens and cares upon him, committing our ſelves and all our affairs to him, and fetching in all our ſtrength from him. Chriſt tells us, <hi>Whatever we ask the Father in his Name ſhall be given to us,</hi> John 15.16. John 16.23, 26. <hi>For whatever we ask in Prayer, believing, we ſhall receive,</hi> Mat. 21.22. Jam. 5.15. So that if we would be enabled to do all in the Name of Chriſt, we muſt Exerciſe Faith in his Name in Prayer to God for all things, for he is in Office in Heaven for this purpoſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25. <hi>for he ever Liveth to make Interceſſion for us.</hi> The hand of Faith put forth in Prayer, though but in ejaculatory Prayer, draws vertue from Heaven; as we read, when he was on Earth, thoſe that did but touch him drew vertue from him, <hi>Luke</hi> 6.19. <hi>Luke</hi> 8.46.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Living cloſe and ſecret Communion with the Lord Jeſus in the uſe of all his Ordinances, by and through which he communicates himſelf in the fulneſs and freeneſs of Life, Light, Love, and Grace to our Souls; for they be the Golden Pipes ſpoken of, <hi>Zach.</hi> 4.12. by which the Golden Oyl is convey'd to our Souls, for his Name is an oyntment poured forth in dayes of Holy Communion, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3. By this means we come to have further acquaintance with him, and peace from him; to ſee his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Glory, and our Souls to be ſatisfied as with marrow and fatneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.5. and to be changed into his Image, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. and to be
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:95740:299"/> refreſhed with fuller taſts of his love, which is better than Wine.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Exerciſe your thoughts much upon him, and be much taken up with him in the courſe of your lives: but in a ſpecial manner, upon ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar occaſions. The Pſalmiſt <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23. ſaith, I am continually with thee, that was, in his heart and thoughts. Let your thoughts be taken up much in the conſideration how to manage your affairs, ſo as may be according to the mind of Chriſt by ſtrength derived from him, and for his honour, that we may be accepted in our works. Perhaps you will object, that it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible we ſhould in every buſineſs of our lives have actual thoughts of Chriſt and his Glory, or go actually to him for aſſiſtance and guidance in every particular buſineſs. I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There may and muſt be an habitual, gracious, holy frame of heart in us wrought by the Spirit, by which we may be ſtrongly inclined to the Lord Chriſt, and his Word as our Rule, and his Glory as our end; ſo that we do in the full purpoſe of our hearts reſolve to truſt in him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit our ſelves to him, and reſt upon him for help, aſſiſtance, guidance, acceptance, and ſucceſs in all things. What <hi>David</hi> pray'd for, for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and people, when they were in a good frame of heart, is the deſire and endeavour of every believer, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.18. <hi>(viz.)</hi> that the Lord would keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of their hearts, and prepare their hearts unto him: This is the habitual preparation of the heart for God; this frame of heart is the New Creature in us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When we have eſpecial and particular work to do for Chriſt, then there ought to be an actual preparation of our hearts for him, and ſtirring up the grace that is in us, an actual making out after him, and laying hold on him for ſtrength and grace from him in time of need, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. <hi>laſt.</hi> This is eſpecially to be done upon more ſolemn and momentous occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, then we muſt in an eſpecial manner think upon that word that was ſpoken to <hi>Iſrael, Amos</hi> 4.11. Prepare to meet thy God. We read, <hi>Exod.</hi> 40.30, 31. there was a Laver before the Altar, in which they were to waſh before they went into the Congregation for ſervice. We cannot ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie God in an Ordinance, except we prepare for him, which is all one with ſanctifying of God, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10.3. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.5. <hi>Samuel,</hi> when he came to ſacrifice to the Lord, ſaid to the Elders of <hi>Bethleem, Sanctifie your ſelves, and come with me to the Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The more frequent actual thoughts we have of Chriſt and his Word, and our eye upon the Rule, and his Glory as our end, it is the better ever; therefore we ſhould often call upon our ſelves as <hi>Deborah</hi> did, <hi>Judges</hi> 5.12. <hi>Awake</hi> Deborah, <hi>awake,</hi> &amp;c. There muſt be an actual excitation of our ſelves, and exerciſing of our Graces, when we have ſome ſpecial duty to perform. It is ſaid of <hi>Sampſon, Judges</hi> 16.20. <hi>That he went out and ſhook himſelf, as at other times.</hi> It ſeems to have been his manner, when he went about any great work. We ſhould ſtir up our hearts, and ſend up frequent Ejaculatory Prayers, though we cannot engage in a ſolemn way of duty to God: and much work is done that way, <hi>Exod.</hi> 14.15. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſent up an Ejaculation upon a great exigent, which reached Heaven, yet there was not a word ſpoken by him; yet ſaith God, <hi>Wherefore cryeſt thou unto me?</hi> We ſhould often caſt the eye of Faith up towards God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.22.
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:95740:300"/> as they looked up to the Brazen Serpent, and were healed. The people of God looked to the Temple when they could not come near to it; and the Temple was a Type of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.29, 30, 35. <hi>Jonah</hi> 2.4. This which hath been laid down by way of Direction, I would preſs by way of Exhortation, in a word, to have frequent recourſe to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, ſince he doth ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preſs us to this very thing; the oftner we viſit him, the more enlarged we are in our deſires towards him, the more we receive from him, and the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter welcome we are to him, and the Father for his ſake. He bids us open our mouths wide, and he will fill them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 81.13, 14, 15, 16. and takes it very ill at our hands, when we are ſtraitned in our hearts towards him: We can't go to God as a Father in Chriſt, in Chriſt's Name, but we muſt needs ſpeed, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. laſt verſe, and we can't ſpeed but by him, and upon his account; for 1. We have admittance and acceſs to the Father only by Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. 2. We have aſſiſtance only through him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. 3. In regard of acceptance, which is only in and through him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3, 6. 4. In regard of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.12. Our reward is only by him, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.11, 12. that is a great reward for Chriſt's ſake, eternal Life. The greateſt reward is by Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.23.</p>
            <p>The Fourth thing propounded was ſome Uſes, that ſince we muſt do all in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, hence may be inferred, Firſt, That all our Actions as they muſt be done in his ſtrength, and for his Glory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. So by his Authority, and according to his Rule, and Word. It is not in our Power, nor at our Liberty, to Act as we pleaſe according to our own Fancy, or for our own ends, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.7, 8. <hi>none of us Liveth to himſelf,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, we are none of our own, therefore Living and dying we are the Lords, and ſo in neither at our own diſpoſing. He had ſpoken before of their eating or for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing to eat, how they ought to eat or not to eat according to the Will of God, it muſt be to the Lord's Glory, eſpecially conſidering that he who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires we ſhould do all in his ſtrength and Name, and for his Glory, hath ſuch a Title to us, to lay Laws upon us as none elſe hath, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. So that all our Actions muſt come under ſome Rules general, if not particular.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Piety to God. 2. Of Charity to Men. 3. Of Sobriety to our ſelves. And all this the Goſpel teacheth us, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. <hi>The Grace of God which hath appeared to all Men, teacheth us, that denying all ungodlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>we ſhould Live Soberly, Righteouſly, and Godly in this preſent World:</hi> There is the Rule of the New Creature, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. by which a Saint doth walk in his general and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Calling in all holy Converſation and Godlineſs, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. They are a proud Generation that ſay as they, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 12.4. <hi>Our Tongues are our own, who is Lord over us?</hi> We will not be bounded by any Laws, nor walk by any Rule, nor be controlled by any whatever; but we have not ſo learned Chriſt, we have our bounds and limits ſet us not only in Sacred, but civil things. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> upon <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. ſpeaks fully to our purpoſe, <hi>Fallitur vulgus cum judicat licere ſibi uti victu, veſtitu, ſermone, aut quaecunque adiaphora ſuo arbitrio: nam haec omnia ad Regulam adhibenda ſunt, alioquin licet ipſa re nullum ſit vitium, erit tamen in utente,</hi> The vulgar ſort are much miſtaken, who judge it Lawful for them to uſe their Liberty wholly in Eating, Drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Cloathing, Speaking, or any other indifferent things according to their own wills and pleaſure, for all theſe things are to be brought under Rule,
<pb n="587" facs="tcp:95740:300"/> otherwiſe what is lawful in it ſelf may be unlawful to him that uſeth it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Inference,</hi> That they are very bold and ſawcy wretches, who preſume to entitle Chriſt to their impious and wicked courſes; <hi>In nomine Domini incipit omne malum.</hi> How many do juſtifie themſelves in their ſuperſtitious practices by the Word of God? How many be like Satan, who, when he tempted Chriſt, produced Scripture to enforce his temptations? <hi>Mat.</hi> 4.2, 3, 4, &amp;c. So too many cite Scripture for their <hi>Falſe Worſhips,</hi> and for their Falſe Doctrines, and wicked Lives; <hi>but Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children,</hi> Mat. 11.19. It was a profanation of God's Name, when the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> proclaimed a Feaſt to the Lord, which was to their Idols, <hi>Exod.</hi> 32.5. We find the falſe Apoſtles pretend as much to the Name of Chriſt, as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> did, and to Preach in his Name, though they Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed falſe Doctrine, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.13. And Antichriſt himſelf pretends to be like the Lamb, when he ſpeaks like a Dragon, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Infer.</hi> Hence we infer, That we cannot expect God's Bleſſing upon any thing which is not done in the Name of Chriſt. What we undertake, and not in the fear of the dreadful Name of the Lord <hi>Jehovah,</hi> not for his Honour, and according to his Word, we cannot expect his Bleſſing: None can expect God's guidance, aſſiſtance, or ſucceſs in that which cannot be warranted by the Word of Chriſt, all Bleſſings being wholly and only in his Name, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3. We have all things in Chriſt in a way of Bleſſing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. Whilſt we are with him, he will be with us, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 15.2. While we are with him in a way of Duty, he will be with us in a way of Bleſſing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Infer.</hi> Hence it follows, That it is not in the power of any Perſon by natural or acquired parts to do any thing according to the Rule of Chriſt, or for his Glory, which is not done in his ſtrength; and th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>refore <hi>Paul,</hi> who could do all things through Chriſt which ſtrengthned him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.13. could not ſo much as think a good thought without him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. And this our Lord Chriſt puts out of Queſtion, <hi>John</hi> 15.5. where he tells us, <hi>With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me ye can do nothing.</hi> It is not in the name of the moſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>cellent parts, or gifts, or grace whatever, that we can do any thing acceptable or well pleaſing to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Infer.</hi> Whatever Excellency there is in any Action or worthy Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo as to commend it to God, it is from Chriſt through Faith in his Name. Though the Action may be a common Action in it ſelf, or perhaps, ſome baſe ſervile low imployment, yet being done in the Name of Chriſt, with Faith in him, with care and conſcience to pleaſe him, ſuch an Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on far ſurpaſſeth the great and noble exploit of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> of <hi>Pompey,</hi> or <hi>Caeſar,</hi> or of any of the Renowned Hero's in the World, who in the name of parts or gifts or any acquired Excellencies have done great things in the World. There may be a great difference betwixt Perſons and their Imployments, as betwixt a Prince and a Peaſant in their places, and yet a poor Peaſant doing ſome common work in an ordinary way, it may be a piece of drudgery, yet his work being done by Faith in Chriſt's Name, it doth as much ſurpaſs the Perſon and Actions of a Prince in a
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:95740:301"/> worth and Excellency, which doth not manage his Publick and weighty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State in the Name of Chriſt, as the Prince doth ſurpaſs him in place. They have great advantage above all others, who go about their common Imployments in the Name of Chriſt, and for the honour of Chriſt, above all others who Act in their own name; as it was with <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Goliah,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.45. The loweſt Actions done by Faith have a very great honour put upon them by the Spirit of God above all others, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.31. The Harlot <hi>Rahab</hi> receiving the Spies by Faith, is put among the worthies upon that account. Civil and natural Actions done in the Name of Chriſt are raiſed to a very great height, to have the name of Religious put upon them: Thus doth Faith in Chriſt's Name turn Braſs and Copper into Gold. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaith, that if he might have his Option, he would rather chuſe the loweſt and baſeſt Imployment of a poor Ruſtick, or Maid-Servant, doing their work in Faith, before all the Victories and Triumphs of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the Great,</hi> or <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> Why? Becauſe <hi>hic eſt Deus, illic eſt Diabolus; haec eſt differentia eſſentialis, hoc non omnes poſſunt cernere, neque</hi> Eraſmus <hi>quidem vidit;</hi> that is, becauſe with a poor Saint God is, and the Devil with them; and this is an eſſential difference betwixt them, every one does not ſee it; <hi>Eraſmus</hi> himſelf did not perceive it. By this Name the moſt contemptible Perſons in the World are come to be renowned in the Church, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2, 38, 39. Thoſe that Live by Faith on that Name, had a great and good Report in Heaven, and though they were deſpiſed by the World, yet the World was not worthy of them. God never ſpeaks ſuch a word of all the men of great Name in the World, as he does of the pooreſt Saint on Earth, <hi>that the World is not worthy of them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sure I am that many of thoſe great Men of the World were not worthy to Live in the World: the World was weary of them, and the worſe for them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Infer.</hi> If all we do well in the World is to be done in Chriſt's Name, and through his ſtrength, it is very fit that we ſhould give him the glory of all: Since all we can do is of him, and from him, all muſt be to him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. We find in <hi>Rev.</hi> 5.8, 9, 10, &amp;c. <hi>that the Saints and Angels fell down and gave glory to God, and to the Lamb.</hi> The Lord is very jealous of his Honour, when Men take the glory that is due to him to themſelves, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to their own Acts; and as God is jealous of his Honour, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42.8. and will endure to have no Co-partners with him: ſo the Servants of Chriſt are alſo jealous of themſelves, leſt when they have done worthily, they ſhould rob him of his Honour; and therefore, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had ſaid, <hi>I laboured more abundantly than they all,</hi> ſeems preſently to correct himſelf, <hi>yet not I, but the Grace of God in me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Infer.</hi> Hence it will follow that whatever Service or Worſhip is done in any Name to God, than that of Chriſt, it is rejected; or what is done in his Name, but not according to his mind is abhorred of God, though he may do that which is commanded by God, which for Subſtance may be the ſame that a Believer doth, yet being not done in the Name of Chriſt God abhors it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.3. Though they did Sacrifice ſuch things as God commanded,<note place="margin">Iſa 58.1, 2, 3, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </note> yet being not done in the Name of the Lord for his Glory, and
<pb n="589" facs="tcp:95740:301"/> according to his Word, it is rejected of God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12. Their Incenſe, which was appointed for expiation, was an abomination to God: ſo that all the Worſhip of the Jewiſh Synagogue was abhorr'd of God, becauſe the Name of Chriſt is abhorred by them; and all the Services of Papiſts, who are of the Synagogue of Satan, which are tendered in the Name of Saints or Angels, or of their own merit or Righteouſneſs, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with greateſt deteſtation; all the Service of the whole Nations of Turks, what are done in the Name of <hi>Mahomet</hi> and their Alchoran, are an abomination to God.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Infer.</hi> Hence Learn, that there is no honouring of God, but in the Name of his Son, <hi>John</hi> 5.23. There can be no true praiſe given to God in any work by any Perſon, but in and through Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.10. We are Created in Chriſt Jeſus to good Works; ſo as they muſt be a new Created People through Chriſt, which are a People to his Praiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102.8. The loweſt, meaneſt work done by Faith in Chriſt, as it brings great Honour to God, ſo it is greatly honoured by God, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. A Cup of cold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter given upon the account of Chriſt has a great reward from him. <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian</hi> ſpeaks to this point very notably, <hi>non perdiderit mercedem ſuam,</hi> Mat. 10.42. <hi>Etiam eam rem in futuro habituram praemium eſſe dicit, quae in praeſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti praetium non dabit; tantum honoris cultori ſuo tribuit, ut aliquid eſſet per fidem, quod hic omnino nihil eſſet per ſervilitatem,</hi> He ſhall not loſe his reward (ſays he) in the World to come; he ſhall have a great reward, which perhaps in the preſent Life he may miſs of; ſo great an honour is God pleaſed to put upon an Action done in Faith, however mean and inconſiderable, and which by reaſon of its vileneſs in the eyes of men is nothing. A viſit of a poor Member of Chriſt, ſick or in Priſon, or an Alms given to feed or cloath them, what an honour is put upon theſe at the laſt day? <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.34, 35, 36. But what ſhall we think of <hi>Cyrus</hi> and <hi>Darius,</hi> and others, who did ſo great things for the Church of God? <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45.1, 2, 3, 4. And of the King of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> who upon account of the Protection that the People of God had from him, is called the Anointed Cherub that covereth? <hi>Ezek.</hi> 28.14, 16. To this I Anſwer, that as for <hi>Cyrus,</hi> though God made great uſe of him, yet the Lord ſays expreſly of him, that he know him not; and therefore as for all thoſe Actions they did for the Church of God, though God did gain Honour by them, yet they did not honour God, nor were they accepted of him, becauſe they were not in Chriſt.</p>

Study it, that you may be able to comprehend with all Saints, what is the height and depth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of it, that you may be filled with all the fulneſs of God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.18, 19. There is a ſurpaſſing Excellency as in that Name, ſo in the knowledge of it, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. for by this knowledge we come to the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and cleareſt diſcoveries of the Glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt; the Lord ſhines into the hearts of ſuch Students, and communicates a glorious Light unto them.</p>

Others are to be blamed, even the generality of Profeſſors, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken the Name of Chriſt upon them, and are called by his Name, are a reproach to this high and holy Name, who are ſo far from doing all things in the Name of Chriſt, as they do nothing in his Name, but do live againſt that Name, they do not depart from iniquity, as every Chriſtian upon that account ought to do, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.19. How many ſay they are Chriſtians but are not? <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.9.

To the like purpoſe <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks concerning the Jews, who were high pretenders to the Law, yet lived in the continual breach of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Through them the Name of God was blaſphemed among the Gentiles.</hi> So 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. He had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of ſome, who by their Doctrines denyed the Lord Chriſt that bought them, by reaſon of whom the way of truth was evil ſpoken of by the falſe Doctrines and flagitious lives of Profeſſors, the Name and Religion of Chriſt is rent and torn in pieces, and brought into contempt among the worſt of men. And therefore we find, that when Profeſſors are preſſed to walk as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cometh the Goſpel, one great Argument is taken from the great reproach that elſe will follow, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. he preſſeth ſervants to account their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters worthy of double honour, that the Name of God, and his Doctrine be not blaſphemed. The like Argument we have upon Wives, that they be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> obedient to their own Husbands, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.4. that the Word of God be not blaſphemed, that the way of Religion, in which they profeſs to ſerve God, be not made vile and contemptible in the eyes of ſuch as have little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any Religion at all. <hi>Averroes</hi> was moſt taken with the Chriſtians Sect, (as he called it) but when he ſaw the Chriſtians do what he thought was a great offence againſt the God whom they ſerved or worſhipped, he ſaid, <hi>Moriatur anima mea cum Philoſophis,</hi> Let me die amongſt the Philoſophers,
<pb n="592" facs="tcp:95740:303"/> and not among the Chriſtians. It is reported of one <hi>Hathway</hi> an <hi>Indian,</hi> as blind as he was, ſo poſſeſſed with prejudice againſt the Chriſtian Religion by the cruelty of the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> that he refuſed to be Baptized, becauſe of their vile carriage, and ſaid he would not go to the ſame Heaven with them.</p>
            <p>Of all perſons, Chriſtians have cauſe to walk moſt wiſely, and uprightly, in reference to that honourable Name which they bear, leſt otherwiſe they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it to contempt. Let us do as the Primitive Saints did, <hi>Acts</hi> 9.31. of whom it is ſaid they walked in the fear of the Lord, and the Churches had reſt. They were in the midſt of perſecuting bloudy Enemies, who ſeeing them walk in the fear of the Lord, and according to the Rules of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion, which did ſtrike ſuch an awe into them of the Majeſty of their Religion, which did ſhine forth in their holy, heavenly Converſation, as brought their Enemies under ſo great Convictions, as they durſt not at that preſent attempt them, or hinder their peace. A Saint ſanctifies the Name of the Lord in the courſe of his life, while he walks in the fear of the Lord, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 8.13.</p>
            <p>This was a great Argument which prevailed with <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded it to the people, to walk in the fear of the Lord, becauſe of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the Enemy, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 8.9. It is not the <hi>Jew</hi> which denieth the Name of Chriſt, or the <hi>Turk</hi> which defieth it, or the <hi>Pagan Dragon,</hi> Rev. 12.2, 3. which perſecuteth the Name of Chriſt, that caſts ſo ſoul a blot and reproach upon the Name of Chriſt, as he which takes upon him the Name of Chriſt, and under a form of godlineſs lives in the practice of thoſe foul abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1, 2, 5. from which turn away.</p>

            <p>Now the words of the Text do contain this Preparatory Work of the Goſpel upon poor Sinners, in order to due reception of Chriſt, and, aright application of him by Faith unto the Soul. It conſiſts of two parts, 1. Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling down Mountains. 2. Filling up Valleys, both very difficult work. <hi>John</hi> had to do with ſome, who were puft up with a conceit of their own Righteouſneſs and would be their own Saviours, and not be beholding to Chriſt and free Grace for any thing, thinking themſelves to be ſomething, when indeed they were nothing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.3. <hi>Revel.</hi> 3.16, 17. Theſe were the proud Phariſees boaſting of their own Righteouſneſs; and beſides theſe there are alſo a company of Profane Atheiſtical Sadducees, who gloried in their ſins, and denying the Reſurrection of the Body, and the Immortality of the Soul, ran out into all licentiouſneſs.</p>
            <p>Others again were ſo convinc'd of Sin, and of the dangerous conſequence of it, that they were ready to ſink into Deſpair, knew not what to do, fearing their ſins were greater than could be forgiven, theſe are the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains and Valleys in the Text. Preſumption on the one hand, and Deſpair on the other, that riſes too high, this ſinks too low, that inclines too much one way, this too much the other; and there is a crookedneſs and obliquity in both, which muſt be rectified and ſtraightened by the Preaching of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in order to the Remiſſion of Sins: This <hi>John</hi> doth, firſt urging the neceſſity of Repentance upon the proud Phariſees, who thought they needed no Repentance, <hi>Luke</hi> 15.7. Secondly urging the great Goſpel Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledge that Chriſt hath purchaſed for Believers upon their repentance, <hi>viz.</hi> Remiſſion of Sins, upon poor dejected Sinners, that both the one and the other might ſee the right way of Salvation by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> for though the Light of Nature, by which we are convinc'd of the equity and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Moral Law, do bind us to Repentance, when we act againſt it, yet it cannot promiſe that we ſhall get any thing by our Repentance, being altogether ignorant of the Myſtery of the Goſpel. Thus we ſee the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains muſt be brought low, and the Valleys filled up, and both reduc'd to ſuch an exact level, evenneſs, and plainneſs, that Chriſt may ſit cloſe upon the ſoul without the leaſt interpoſition of any thing between him and us, or the leaſt remaining vacuity or emptineſs in our ſelves, into which his Fulneſs doth not deſcend, making up whatſoever is wanting in us; and when it is ſo, there is a through perfect cloſure with Chriſt in the greateſt nearneſs, in the ſtricteſt and moſt intimate union that can be.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, How ſhall we come to this? How ſhall we walk thus be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Mountain and the Valley in a ſtreight direct line of Faith and Hope to <hi>Jeſus Chriſt?</hi> which brings me to the Caſe or Queſtion now to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to from the Text, which is this, <hi>viz. How may we ſteer an even courſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Preſumption and Deſpair?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The true ſtate of this Queſtion depends upon a clear diſcovery of the real difference that is between the Grace of Hope, and both theſe extreams, Preſumption and Deſpair; therefore</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſhall diſtinguiſh between Preſumption and Hope. The difference between Hope and Deſpair is more apparent; but we are too too apt to
<pb n="595" facs="tcp:95740:305"/> confound Preſumption and Hope, there being a greater Affinity between theſe than the other; as in Morality, ſome vertue? come nearer to one ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, than to the other: So here, there is ſomething of the general na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Hope in Preſumption. <hi>Preſumptio non excludit ſpem ſed rectitud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nem ſpei,</hi> Zanch. Therefore we muſt be the more acurate, and ſtrict in diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing between the <hi>Grace</hi> of Hope, and the <hi>Sin</hi> of Preſumprion, which <hi>fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lente quâdam Specie (Aquinas)</hi> reſembles the grace of Hope; and thoſe who are guilty of this Sin, do alwayes put the ſpecious name of Hope up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it; they are not ſenſible of any Preſumption as others are of Deſpair, and therefore their caſe is more dangerous; <hi>Eo magis deſperati quo minus deſperantes, Ameſ. de Conſc.</hi> And where one deſpairs, thouſands do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume.</p>
            <p>Before I come to particulars I muſt diſtinguiſh of a double Preſumption.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. Of our Selves and our own merits.</item>
               <item>2. Of God, and his mercy.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Both ſtand in a direct oppoſition to the true Grace of Hope, and I ſhall ſhew you where the difference lies. I begin with</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Firſt ſort of Preſumption, which is of our ſelves. This is a proud arrogant preſumption, ariſing from a vain conceit of our own ſuppoſed worth, and righteouſneſs; we think to ſtand upon our own legs, inſiſting not upon what Chriſt is to us, or hath done for us, but upon what we are in and to our ſelves, and have done for Chriſt. <hi>We have Prophecied in thy Name, &amp;c.</hi> Mat. 7.22. We are not as this Publican, we have done thus and thus, and ought to be conſidered for our good works; and we doubt not but we ſhall: 'tis not the Promiſes of Free-grace, but the Law, and their ſtrict obſervance of that, which theſe men ground their hope upon. But the true Grace of Hope is alwayes grounded upon Faith in the Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and is all along fed, nouriſh'd, maintain'd, and ſtrengthened by thoſe believing perſwaſions, that it hath of the truth of thoſe Promiſes, which at firſt produced and begat this hope in the Soul, and in the continual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of this Grace, in its daily actings, it eyes the Promiſes, hath daily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to them for its further confirmation, 'tis bottomed upon them, takes its riſe from thence, and bears up the Soul upon the credit of them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.4. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.74. this is <hi>the hope of the Goſpel,</hi> Col. 1.23. that carries us out of our ſelves. A Chriſtian's Hope is hope in another, and not in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The right notion of Hope, as it is an Evangelical Grace, implies our ſole dependance upon God, as the only Author and Fountain of all that good which we deſire and look for; which doth ſufficiently difference it from that falſe hope, or ſelf-preſumption, that I have been ſpeaking of, and which was principally aimed at by <hi>John</hi> in the Text, being a Preſumption more peculiar to thoſe times, and perſons here ſpoken of, who lived under the Law, and were much in doing, but underſtood not the End of their Moral or Ceremonial Works, but truſted in them, and made Saviours of them; and at the firſt entrance of the Goſpel they oppoſed the Doctrine of Free-grace, would hear neither <hi>John</hi> nor Chriſt himſelf, but <hi>rejected the Counſel of God againſt themſelves,</hi> Luke 7.30, 33, 34. See what a Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter <hi>Paul</hi> gives of them, and of all others throughout the world, who ſhould entertain the leaſt thought of Salvation out of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.16, 17.
<pb n="596" facs="tcp:95740:306"/> 
               <hi>Deſtruction and miſery are in their wayes, and the way of peace have they not known.</hi> This one Scripture, if well weighed, is enough to ſhake the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of the moſt Preſumptuous Self-juſtitiary that is, and to convince him, and all the world of their need of Chriſt. In <hi>Pſal.</hi> 14. which <hi>Paul</hi> quotes in this Chapter, God is brought in taking a ſtrict Survey of Mankind, before he ſent his Son into the World, to ſee if there were any that ſtood in no need of him. <hi>q. d.</hi> If there be any ſuch, let him come forth and ſhew himſelf. <hi>David</hi> anſwers for himſelf, <hi>ver.</hi> 7. Not I Lord, not I Lord, I wait for Chriſt, I long for Chriſt. <hi>O that the Salvation of Iſrael were come out of Zion.</hi> O that Chriſt were come, that the Free grace and mercy of God were more clearly revealed, then <hi>Jacob ſhall rejoice, and Iſrael ſhall be glad;</hi> this will be good news indeed. So <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6, 7. The reſult of all is this, true Hope eyes God in Chriſt, and argues from him: this Preſumption now ſpoken of, eyes ſelf, and argues from thence in all its actings.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſort of Preſumption to be diſtinguiſh'd from Hope is that by which we preſume upon God, and his mercy. This is grown up ſince the preaching of the Goſpel: there is indeed too great a ſpice of the former Preſumption among Profeſſors, and as that vvears off, this ſucceeds, nay, they unhappily mingle together. If Legal Preſumption cannot altogether ſhut out conviction, yet it minces the matter, 'tis a little one, and my Soul ſhall live, and ſo makes vvay for this credulous preſumption, that brings in a Salvo for all preſently; God is gracious, mercy is promiſed, Chriſt has died for Sinners, and all vvill be vvell, vve ſhall go to Heaven of courſe vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more ado; and ſo they ſit down in ſecurity all their dayes, till they are ſurprized, vvith their everlaſting doom unawares. This is <hi>Infidelis fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducia</hi> (Bern.) a faithleſs confidence, a fond credulous preſumption, ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from a groundleſs over eaſie perſwaſion of the mercy of God towards us; this kind of Preſumption may be joyn'd vvith ſome ſenſe and convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſin, and the dangerous conſequence of it, but preſently ſalves all vvith the general air and breath of a Promiſe miſconſtrued and miſapplied.</p>
            <p>The Miſtakes are theſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This is more Fancy than Faith or Hope. 'Tis a vain imagination, that deludes men into a belief and expectation of that vvhich they are in no likelihood of, in no capacity for: they promiſe themſelves vvhat God hath never promiſed, cry peace, peace, vvhen God hath not ſpoken peace.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Such an one doth not rightly diſtinguiſh between the vvorkings of natural affection towards any good propounded, and the rational actings of Hope for the obtaining of it in a probable or certain vvay, in the uſe of due and proper means: Heaven, glory, and eternal Life, are good vvords, and better things, at the firſt mention of them, vve naturally deſire them, and vviſh for them, but ſhall vve be carried away vvith a meer ſound of vvords? muſt vve needs have all vve hear of? vve ſhall quickly bring our ſelves into a fools Paradiſe this vvay, dreaming vve eat, and yet awake an hungry: there is more ado than ſo to inherit, the Promiſes; vve muſt prove our title firſt; the Promiſes give us an intereſt in Heaven, but 'tis Chriſt, that gives us an intereſt in the Promiſes, he opens the mouth of a Promiſe to ſpeak comfort to us, in him they are all Yea, and Amen, but out of him they all cry no, no, vve have nothing for you, vvho
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:95740:306"/> are out of Chriſt, they vvill deny all the vvorld, that come not in his Name, and never let out any thing of their treaſure to ſuch; no vvringing out of one drop of ſolid comfort: The bare Hiſtory or outward Relation of the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of God in the letter of the Word, gives us no intereſt in the things pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed: the carnal <hi>Jews,</hi> as <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves, had the Promiſes and boaſted of them, but got little by them: Chriſt is the door of every Promiſe, let us not think to make a forceable entry, to climb up at the vvindows like Theives to ſteal out mercy, as if vve cared not how vve came by it; you vvill find vvhat is ſo gotten vvill thrive accordingly, and quickly come to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. What I drive at is this: 'tis not the report of the vvorth or amiable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a thing, but an apprehenſion of the poſſibility of it as to us, that cauſes hope; till vve are clear in this, our hope cannot act rationally: if it have no other ground, beſides our own deſires and natural inclinations raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and kindled in us by the ſpecious appearance and raviſhing beauty of ſome taking objects, this argues rather vvhat vve vvould have, than any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lyhood of obtaining of our vviſhes, vvhich is of the very eſſence of hope: ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſires are very apt to run out into a forward preſuming hope, vve know not vvell vvhy or vvherefore. <hi>Quae volumus facile credimus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another miſtake in this fond credulous preſumption is, that it takes up promiſes in its own ſenſe, and not in the true ſenſe and meaning of God. So the <hi>Jews, John</hi> 8.33. cryed they were <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and the Promiſe run in theſe very words, <hi>to Abraham and his ſeed,</hi> therefore who but they muſt be included in it? but it was the Spiritual ſeed that God meant, not that after the fleſh; <hi>they are not all Iſrael, which are of Iſrael,</hi> Rom. 9.6. No ſayes Chriſt, you are the Children of the Devil, <hi>of your Father the Devil,</hi> John 8.44. <hi>and they took up ſtones and threw at him,</hi> ver. 59. being not able to bear any contradiction to their falſe hopes. So when we read thoſe Promiſes of ſalvation to thoſe that come to Chriſt, believe in him, call upon his Name, we muſt not underſtand them, as if a bare form of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and crying, <hi>Lord have mercy upon us,</hi> would bring us to heaven: No, My brethren, the Myſtery of Religion lies deeper than ſo; 'tis the labour of the heart, that requires the greateſt diligence, intention, and ſeriouſneſs imaginable, ſtrong workings within, great agonies and contentions of Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in our dealings with God in any duty: The life of our Worſhip does conſiſt in theſe inward ſpiritual motions of the Soul towards God. This is that <hi>coming,</hi> that <hi>believing,</hi> that <hi>praying,</hi> to which Salvation is promiſed. The grace of Hope enquires after the Secrets of the Covenant, the real in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent and mind of God in every Promiſe, prayes for a right underſtanding of all particulars, <hi>Open my eyes, that I may ſee the wonders of thy Law,</hi> Pſal. 119.18. Beſides the true meaning of a Promiſe a Child of God is very ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous to know, whether God do indeed mean him, and ſpeak to him, and offer thoſe pearls to him; whether he be a perſon rightly qualified, and under all thoſe due circumſtances, that belong to perſons, entertaining ſuch an hope, 'tis a great comfort and ſatisfaction to a Believer, when God does own his hope, and encourage him in it, by ſome ſenſible demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of his undoubted intereſt in ſuch and ſuch Promiſes; he hears God ſaying to him, take, eat, this is thy portion purchaſed by Chriſt for thee, thou art my Child, and this is childrens bread, it belongeth to thee:
<pb n="598" facs="tcp:95740:307"/> While we are muſing and praying over a promiſe, God does ſometimes feed us out of that promiſe himſelf, and with his own hand puts many a ſweet morſel into our mouths.</p>
            <p>O this is overcoming kindneſs; this is a double, a treble welcome, to have ſuch fare, and the Maſter of the Feaſt ſtanding by, and looking on, and carving to us himſelf, and crying out as it is, Cant. 5.1. <hi>Eat O my friends, drink, yea drink abundantly O beloved.</hi> When we have ſhut our Bibles, and have done with a promiſe, and are ſetting down the Cup of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation out of our hands, God many times makes us to mend our draught, and go deeper than ever we did: <hi>drink, yea drink abundantly, O beloved.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But preſumption is a bold gueſt, thruſts in uninvited, catches at this and that in a rude manner. The word <hi>Preſumption</hi> notes a taking before-hand, before 'tis offer'd, before 'tis due: before he is called, he runs away with a promiſe, puts his own ſenſe upon it, and deludes himſelf with vain hopes from it, and when the King comes to review his Gueſts ſhall be <hi>caſt out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to outer darkneſs,</hi> Mat. 22.11, 12, 13.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another errour or miſtake in preſumption is, that it picks and chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes out ſome Promiſes, and rejects others; the priviledges of the Saints it catcheth at freedom from condemnation, eternal life and glory; but the Promiſes of Grace, Sanctification, and Holineſs, it minds not; it hopes to ſee God without Holineſs, and to go to Heaven as well as the beſt, it is more for the wages than for the work.</p>
            <p>But the grace of Hope faſtens upon every Promiſe, gathers honey out of every flower, is as earneſt for grace as for glory. <hi>Thou haſt delivered my ſoul from death, wilt thou not deliver my feet from falling,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 56.13. and <hi>refrain them from every evil way, Pſal.</hi> 119.101. <hi>Lord I have hoped for thy Salvation, and done thy commandements, Pſal.</hi> 119.166. But Preſumption makes men more remiſs and careleſs in their whole courſe; it does not quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en our endeavours, and make us more active for God, as hope does, by which we purifie our ſelves, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.3. it puts us upon preparing our ſelves for the actual poſſeſſion of what we hope for, that we may be meet for the Kingdom of God, and ready to enter in with the Bridegroom, it uſes all means to attain its end. If thy hope be not a heart-purifying hope, a life-reforming hope, 'tis no better than preſumption, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.13. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37.3.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Thoſe things that preſumption counts upon in a careleſs way, it doth not bring them ſo cloſe to the Soul: it doth not give us that lively taſte and ſenſe of them as true hope does, they do not work ſo kindly upon the heart; Preſumption apprehends ſomething in groſs in a confuſed manner, pleaſing it ſelf with the names and empty notions of things, rather than with the things themſelves, is contented with a negative happineſs, and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands no more by going to heaven and being ſaved, than that he ſhall not be damned and be tormented in hell. A preſumptuous perſon knows not what heaven is, what the bleſſedneſs of the Saints is, he ſtudies not thoſe things, but at all adventures he would exchange hell for heaven, and pleaſeth himſelf with an imaginary happineſs. Preſumption never makes men hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly minded, for all their high words and confident boaſting, yet they are not in earneſt for heaven; they don't ſavour theſe things, ſomething they
<pb n="599" facs="tcp:95740:307"/> muſt ſay, ſomething they muſt pretend to, to ſilence their conſciences, and to keep down thoſe fears that otherwiſe would diſtract them. <hi>There may be an affectation of heaven, where there is no true affection for it:</hi> Heaven, glory, and eternal life are gay things, and ſignifie ſome great good, but what they know not.</p>
            <p>But hope brings things home to the heart, we ſee the ſubſtance of what we hope for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. Faith comments upon our hope, diſcourſes of the excellent nature of thoſe things we wait for, tells us many pleaſing ſtories of heaven and Chriſt, and the glory that is above, this mightily heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens hope, raviſhes the ſoul, makes it even leap for joy that its reward ſhall be ſo great in heaven; faith lifts us up within the vail, gives us a ſtrong taſte of the powers of the world to come, and ſo feeds and nouriſhes hope, encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rages it to a patient waiting for that which will quit coſt at laſt, and fully anſwer our expectations.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Preſumption as it neglects the uſe of all means for the attaining its end (as I ſaid before) ſo it is ſignally guilty of the neglect of Prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10.4. 'Tis the preſumptuous ſinner bleſſing himſelf in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs <hi>David</hi> there ſpeaks of, <hi>verſe</hi> 3. But true Hope is full of holy brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and longings after that which it hopes for, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.2. That hope may well be ſuſpected, that puts us not upon frequent and earneſt prayer; <hi>they have little ground for their hope of Salvation,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Omne deſideri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um poſt ſpem impatientius.</note> 
               <hi>who call not upon the Lord, Rom.</hi> 10.13. If thy hope be not a praying hope, 'tis a preſuming hope.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Preſumption, though it talk much of Chriſt, as one who muſt do all for us, and will ſave us, yet ſuch an one ſtudies not the myſtery of Chriſt, doth not make it his buſineſs to ſearch the Scripture, to enquire after him, to ſatisfie himſelf about him, that he is able to ſave. Herein appears the unreaſonableneſs of this ſin, we truſt we know not whom; for a man to commit his greateſt concern to an unknown hand, and to reſt ſecure is very unreaſonable, but true Hope is well acquainted with Chriſt, much in the ſtudies of the Myſtery of Chriſt, having repos'd ſo great a truſt in him is very deſirous to know him throughly, and can never act with confidence till then. <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith <hi>Paul) in whom I have believed, and am perſwaded, that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.12. I dare truſt him he wo'nt fail me. The reaſon of our hope muſt be fetch't from ſomewhat in Chriſt, rendring him ſufficient for the work he hath undertaken, elſe 'tis unreaſonable, nay it muſt needs ſink and die <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Chriſt, without hope, Eph.</hi> 2.12. When God ſent Chriſt into the world to ſave us, what a high Character doth he give of him, purpoſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to encourage us to truſt in him? <hi>I have laid help upon one that is mighty,</hi> Pſal. 89.19. <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt, mighty to ſave,</hi> Iſa. 63.1. Iſa. 49.26. Take all the promiſes of the Goſpel, nay all the contents of the Bible, and conſider them apart by themſelves, not in conjunction with God, nor in relation to him, who is the author and owner of them, and the great undertaker of all things mentioned therein, we ſhall have little ground to believe them, but <hi>in God I will praiſe his word,</hi> Pſal. 56.4. <hi>In God I have put my truſt. ibid. Chriſt in us</hi> is our <hi>hope of glory,</hi> Col. 1.27. How glad is a believer to hear any thing of the fulneſs, power and excellency of
<pb n="600" facs="tcp:95740:308"/> Chriſt, O his heart leaps within, this is my God, my Saviour, my Redeemer, what a happy man am I? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 144.15. <hi>This is my beloved, and this is my friend O daughter of Jeruſalem,</hi> Cantic. 5.16. A believer is very proud of Chriſt, (if I may ſo ſpeak) this enlivens hope and raiſes it to a very high pitch; if our thoughts of Chriſt and love to him be not raiſed and heightened by our hope in him, 'tis not right — There is nothing more common in the mouths of the ignorant profane ſort than to ſay, I hope to be ſaved by Jeſus Chriſt; but who ever thou art that ſayſt ſo of courſe, not minding what thou ſayſt, take up thoſe words again, and make common ſenſe of them, if thou canſt, to thy own underſtanding: what? hope to be ſaved by Chriſt whom thou knoweſt not, haſt no acquaintance with, art a meer ſtranger to! O lay aſide thoſe vain hopes till thou haſt learned Chriſt; let me enjoyn thee never to utter thoſe words more till thou knoweſt Chriſt better: how poſſible thy Salvation may be I will not now diſpute; but I am ſure thy preſent hopes of it are very unreaſonable and groundleſs.</p>
            <p>Thus having ſhew'd the difference between Preſumption and Hope, I ſhall in the next place ſpeak ſomething but more briefly of the difference between Deſpair and Hope. As I did before diſtinguiſh of a double Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, ſo I muſt in the ſame terms diſtinguiſh of a double De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair.</p>
            <p>Deſpair is either <list>
                  <item>1. Of our Selves, which is an humble, holy deſpair, very conſiſtent with hope, and a neceſſary preparation, and intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to it: a valley never to be fill'd up; the Goſpel doth by no means allow of Self-Exaltation; no fleſh muſt glory in his preſence. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.29. we muſt ſtill ſeem vile in our own eyes.</item>
                  <item>2. Of God and of his mercy which is two-fold. <list>
                        <item>1. Privative, which is a total privation of the habit, root, or principle of true ſaving hope, as in all unbelievers.</item>
                        <item>2. Negative, a ceſſation of the acts of hope, which is twofold. <list>
                              <item>A total ceſſation (at leaſt as to our ſenſe and diſcerning) of the actings of Hope for a time, this is temporary Deſpair.</item>
                              <item>Gradual, ariſing from a weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the actings of Hope; which is Deſpair in opinion, counted ſo by weak doubting Chriſtians: both theſe laſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned are incident to true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and occaſion much ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and ſadneſs to them.</item>
                           </list>
                        </item>
                     </list>
                  </item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But this Privation or negation of hope doth not fully ſet forth the nature of deſpair, in which there ſeems to be ſomewhat poſitive, <hi>receſſus a re deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derata</hi> (as the Schools ſpeak) an actual with-drawing from Chriſt, the heart falls off from the Promiſes, doth act againſt them, puts them from us, deſpair argues and reaſons the ſoul out of its hope, puts in a caveat againſt
<pb n="601" facs="tcp:95740:308"/> it ſelf, cannot think that a perſon under ſuch circumſtances can be within the meaning of the promiſe, and ſo ſinks and faints away, <hi>Job</hi> 17.15. This is more than meer privation or negation, there is an evil diſpoſition wrought in the heart by unbelief, which fills the ſoul with many prejudices againſt the truth, makes it pertinaciouſly to adhere unto its own erroneous judgment, ſo that it can do nothing now but quarrel, diſpute, and except againſt all that may be ſaid on t'other ſide.</p>
            <p>Theſe things premis'd I now come to ſhew the difference between De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair and Hope.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Deſpair is the reſult of ſtrong legal convictions, urging the ſentence of the Law againſt us, without any conſideration of Goſpel-Grace for our relief and ſuccour. This works great conſternation, fills the ſoul with amazing fears, ſhuts it up in a dark dungeon, claps it in irons, binds it hand and foot, and ſo leaves it under a fearful expectation of fiery indignation to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour it.</p>
            <p>But Hope deals in the promiſes, is begotten by them, and bears up the ſoul under the condemnation of the Law.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Deſpair indiſpoſes the ſoul from hearkning to the free grace of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel when 'tis offered, becauſe it ſtill retains thoſe ſtrong impreſſions and dreadful apprehenſions which the Law hath wrought, and will not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted.</p>
            <p>But Hope allayes theſe fears, makes the ſoul willing to debate the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to hear what the Goſpel ſayes, to ſee what may be done in ſo dangerous a cauſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Deſpair ſees more in ſin than in Chriſt, and ſuppoſes the wound incu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, <hi>my ſin is greater than can be forgiven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But Hope ſees Grace ſuperabounding, large enough to cover all our ſins.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Deſpair is very peremptory and poſitive in concluding againſt it ſelf; 'tis reſolv'd upon nothing but death, <hi>greater than can be forgiven,</hi> a loſt undone creature to all eternity, it cannot be otherwiſe. As in the higheſt decree of faith and hope, there is aſſurance of ſalvation, ſo here there is a diſmal un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable aſſurance of damnation.</p>
            <p>But Hope though it may be accompanied with many fears and doubts, yet there is ſome expectation of good, a patient looking for and ſollicitous waiting (though ſometimes with trembling) for ſalvation; the ſoul doth not give over its purſuit after life and pardon, but when 'tis at the loweſt ebb doth apprehend ſome poſſibility of eſcape through Chriſt; <hi>it may be</hi> (for all this) <hi>we ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger,</hi> Zeph. 2.3. it may be we ſhall be delivered from the wrath to come. Thus Hope draws on the ſoul to Chriſt encouraging it to come forward.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>Directions how to avoid both extreams.</head>
               <p n="1">1. Againſt Preſumption, whether <list>
                     <item>of our ſelves, or</item>
                     <item>of God.</item>
                  </list>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. Againſt that Preſumption, that is of our ſelves, take theſe following Directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Take up ſo much of a ſenſe of ſin into the mount of Hope as may
<pb n="602" facs="tcp:95740:309"/> keep thy hope from ſwelling into preſumption, or from feeding upon any thing in thy ſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Be much in <hi>proving</hi> thy hope, in giving thy ſelf and others a reaſon of it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.15. this is the way to keep it right: conſider what that reaſon is, whether it be a true Goſpel-ground of hope: as natural affections in a man muſt be guided by reaſon, ſo ſpiritual affections in a Chriſtian muſt be regulated and influenced by Faith. <hi>I believed and therefore have I ſpoken,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.13. ſo it holds here: I believe and therefore do I hope.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Suſpect thoſe acts of Hope, that have their riſe from any thing elſe but Chriſt and the promiſes; the heart of man is deep and very deceitful; 'tis no eaſie matter to underſtand our hope at all times, and to manage it aright, we are apt to forget our ſelves: fleſh will be putting in, and contributing ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing from its ſelf towards the ſupport of our hope; it will be caſting in ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing into the ſcale with Chriſt to make better weight. This we muſt carefully watch againſt, keeping our eye only upon Chriſt, as <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 62.5, 6. When we find our hearts pleaſing themſelves with any ſelf-reflections upon our own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal worth in any kind, we ſhould fear leſt thoſe thoughts ſhould gather too faſt, and puff us up in a vain conceit of our ſelves; we ſhould ſee nothing but meanneſs; vileneſs, and unworthyneſs in our ſelves, under the higheſt actings of our hope in Chriſt. <hi>Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my ſoul,</hi> Job 8.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Begin thy Hope with an act of humble holy deſpair of thy ſelf, that thy hope may be diſcharged on that hand, forc't to quit all expectations from thence, and not be tempted to any ſiniſter aſpect that way, upon ſo poor emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſufficient a thing as thou knoweſt thy ſelf to be. <hi>We know not what to do, but our eyes are upon thee,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.12. Our hope, though it look never ſo directly upon Chriſt, yet it is too too apt to take in ſome collateral encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements from ſelf, which do cauſe a further dilation in the heart, and make ſome ſecret (and if we obſerve our own ſpirit) ſome ſenſible additions to the joy and complacency we have in our hope; we bleſs our ſelves the more, and though we are pleaſed with Chriſt, yet we are pleaſed with ſomething beſides Chriſt; and this ſpoils all, it poyſons our hope, is like a Canker, eats like a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grene, and is a great blemiſh to our hope.</p>
               <p n="5">5. If all this will not do, but ſtill thy proud heart is big with expectation of ſomething from God upon its <hi>own account,</hi> and thou canſt not ſeparate ſelf from Chriſt in the out-goings of thy hope, then my advice is — Anſwer thy fooliſh heart for once in its folly, and take its ſuppoſed worth into thy ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſideration; weigh it well, prove it, examine all its pretences, that the truth may appear: and that you may do this, conſider your ſelves out of Chriſt; 'tis neceſſary for believers to do ſo ſometimes: I do not ſay, you ſhould put off Chriſt, that muſt never be done, but it may be convenient as the caſe ſtands to let the wedding garment hang looſe about you, that you may ſee your own poverty and nakedneſs, and then cover all again, and admire the free grace of God, who hath provided thee a better righteouſneſs, than any thou canſt ſee in thy ſelf, to truſt in, and to ground thy hope upon. This is the way to correct the exorbitancy of thy immoderate hope, and to keep it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in its proper ſphere. We never have more lively heart-raviſhing thoughts and apprehenſions of free grace, than after freſh and warm apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="603" facs="tcp:95740:309"/> of our own vileneſs and wretchedneſs by nature, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 2.3. <hi>by nature the children of wrath,</hi> and then he breaks out into a great admiration of the mercy of God, <hi>verſe</hi> 4.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Directions againſt that kind of Preſumption that is of God and his mercy, which I call'd a fond credulous preſumption.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Study the doctrine of Election, that tells us, that God is the Soveraign Lord of the whole world, hath put a vaſt difference between man and man; there are ſome that he hates, as well as ſome that he loves: of the ſame lump of clay, ſome made <hi>veſſels unto honour,</hi> and <hi>ſome unto diſhonour,</hi> ſome <hi>veſſels of wrath fitted to deſtruction,</hi> ſome <hi>veſſels of mercy prepared unto glory,</hi> Rom. 9.20, 21, 22, 23. That God is a free voluntary Agent, not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily bound to chuſe thee or me rather than others, No, <hi>he hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardneth, verſe</hi> 18.</p>
               <p>Whence is it then that men are ſo confident of the favour of God? you may be in the number of the many that are called, and yet not in the number of thoſe few that are choſen, for all your confidence: hath Electing Redeeming Love ſet any peculiar mark upon thee, by which thou maiſt be known and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhed from the reprobate world at the laſt day? if not, 'tis ſtrange pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption in thee to nouriſh ſuch vain hopes.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Conſider the ſtrict limitations and proviſoes of the Covenant of Grace, by which all obſtinate impenitent ſinners remaining ſuch are ſhut out from mercy; and art not thou ſuch an one? examine thy ſelf, hath grace taught thee to deny ungodlineſs? till then it will never ſave thee.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Conſider the difficulty of Salvation, 'tis not ſo eaſie a matter to get to Heaven as you imagine; <hi>narrow is the way, ſtrait is the gate, and few there be that find it. The righteous are ſcarcely ſaved,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.18. Things that are arduous and difficult are not eaſily ſwallowed, will not in reaſon admit of a raſh credulous hope, but call for ſerious counſel and debate. There are in ſuch caſes many agitations in the mind, <hi>acceſſus &amp; receſſus (Aquin.)</hi> the ſoul goes and comes, backward and forward, off and on, cannot preſently fix and ſettle it ſelf in an even, ſtedfaſt, conſtant hope. Moſt Chriſtians do paſs through ſuch fluctuations and perplexities to a quiet comfortable hope of Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider this alſo, have the promiſes thou boaſteſt ſo much of begot fear in thee as well as hope? A Chriſtian's hope is a heedful, careful, ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous hope, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.1. Hope without fear is preſumption.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Let thy hope be grounded upon ſome inward experience of the mighty ſaving power of Chriſt put forth upon thy ſoul; <hi>experience work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hope,</hi> Rom. 5.4. <hi>Being confident of this very thing, that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it,</hi> Phil. 1.6. <hi>To him that hath ſhall be given,</hi> Mat. 13.12. What pledges then of divine favour, what love-to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kens haſt thou by thee? what taſte and ſight of the goodneſs and grace of God? we hope for the complement and perfection of that which in ſome meaſure we have already attain'd; when we ſee God purſuing us with his kindneſs in any particular expreſſion of his love, this begets hope, that we ſhall have all at laſt, thoſe greater things that are promiſed. God's end in beſtowing leſſer mercies upon us, is to quicken and ſtrengthen our hope
<pb n="604" facs="tcp:95740:310"/> of greater: 'tis ſtrange preſumption for perſons, who never received the leaſt token of ſpecial grace from God, to expect ſuch great things as hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and glory. God gives many things before he gives heaven, don't think at firſt daſh to have heaven; there are many preparatory mercies alwayes antecedent to that; the Saints are compaſſed about with mercy and Songs of deliverance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.7, 10. And from thoſe experiences they argue as <hi>David</hi> did, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17.32. He will do this and that for us, and not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy us after he hath done us ſo much good.</p>
               <p>But if thou haſt nothing to ſhew as a convincing evidence of Gods love and good will to thee, it looks too much like preſumption, to hope for pounds, for the whole ſum, before we have received the earneſt-penny. Hope is not the firſt work of the Spirit upon the heart, 'tis a ſecondary grace, the natural reſult of faith, which gives very ſatisfactory intimations of God's love to us, and ſo begets hope in us. Conſult therefore the experiences of God's goodneſs to you in ſome meaſure, before you ſoar too high in the actings of your hope.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Directions againſt Deſpair.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To thoſe in Chriſt who are ſometimes liable to theſe fainting fits, and find their hope ſhaken, are to ſeek of it, being ſuddenly ſtruck with an amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſight and ſenſe of ſin, and wrath, they conclude their caſe deſperate, and cry out as <hi>Job</hi> did, <hi>Job</hi> 44.19, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The devil hath two wayes or methods, by which he ſeeks to undermine and overthrow the hope of a Chriſtian. I ſhall diſcover both to you, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure you againſt both.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If thy Hope be ſtrong and lively, he will ſlander it with the name of preſumption, that he may ſhake thy confidence, and diſcourage thee from thoſe eminent actings of thy hope wherein thou haſt had ſo much comfort: he does envy thy happineſs, he would fain clip the wings of thy faith and hope, that he may rob thee of the joy of thy Salvation, and keep thee at a low ebb all thy dayes; he would take off thy helmet, that he may knock thee down at one blow.</p>
               <p>Groundleſs fears of preſumption do exceedingly bauk and check our hope, bring it into ſuſpence, which is negative deſpair.</p>
               <p>In ſuch conflicts, and fierce aſſaults, gird up thy ſelf, ſtand faſt, and hope to the end, hold faſt thy confidence; and that you may do this, Call in thy faith to maintain and juſtifie thy hope, as rightly grounded upon Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel-promiſes, and conſequently capable of no exceſs. Let it run in the right Channel never ſo ſwiftly, and riſe never ſo high, 'tis ſo much the better; true grace is not confined to ſuch a ſcantling or degree, it can never be overgrown, its beauty and comelineſs do increaſe with its ſtature; the greater, the larger, the fuller, the higher it is, the more conſpicuous and glorious. Hence are thoſe commendations of grace, where it is in any emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nency; <hi>So great faith, no not in Iſrael,</hi> Mat. 8.10. <hi>O woman great is thy faith,</hi> Mat. 15.28. The Scriptures do exhort us to grow in every grace. <hi>Let theſe things be in you and abound,</hi> 2 Pet. 1.8. 1 Theſſ. 4.1. <hi>More and</hi> more, we can never have too much. <hi>Paul</hi> prayes, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.13. <hi>that we may abound in hope.</hi> Preſumption does not lye in having too high thoughts of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy
<pb n="605" facs="tcp:95740:310"/> of God in Chriſt, for that is infinite, beyond all our conceptions; but in a vain expectation of that from God, which is inconſiſtent with his juſtice and holineſs, and contrary to his revealed will: 'tis not the <hi>Great hope,</hi> but the <hi>Groundleſs hope</hi> that is preſumption: therefore tell the Devil to his face thou wilt <hi>hope more and more,</hi> Pſal. 71.14. That thy hope is a growing hope, ſo far from being too great, that thou doſt judge it yet too little, daily praying for its further increaſe, this is the way to quench thoſe fiery darts. We may obſerve that when temptations do work ſo contrary to the Devils intentions, that inſtead of drawing us into evil, they incite us to more watchfulneſs, and prove occaſions of good, and provocations to duty, they preſently vaniſh and die; the Devil would have it ſo, and uſually it is ſo, unleſs God by a ſpecial hand do continue us under them for the further exerciſe of grace.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If thy Hope be ſmall and weak the Devil will call it Deſpair, he would make thee believe a little grace is no grace; he will argue from thy weakneſs in grace to thy total want of it.</p>
               <p>If under ſuch temptation thou findeſt thy ſpirit ſinking, ready to faint away, rouze up thy ſelf and beſpeak thy Soul, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Why art thou caſt down O my ſoul?</hi> and take theſe following directions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Conſider, it is not the <hi>degree</hi> of grace, but the <hi>truth</hi> of grace, to which Salvation is promiſed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Put a <hi>juſt value</hi> and eſtimate upon the <hi>loweſt degree</hi> of grace, that it may not ſeem contemptible, and as nothing in thy ſight; 'tis more worth than the whole world; a pearl of great price.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Labour to diſtinguiſh aright between the weakneſs of thy grace, and the grace it ſelf that is under that weakneſs; and whileſt thou art mourning under one, be ſure you rejoyce in the other; do not throw away one corn with the chaff, do not ſweep up one groat with the duſt behind the door, but light thy candle, and find it out; don't bury thy talent becauſe 'tis a ſingle one, but be <hi>faithful over a little,</hi> and thou ſhalt be <hi>made ruler over many things,</hi> Mat. 15.21.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Conſider the many promiſes that are made to the loweſt degree of grace; if there be any good thing in thy heart towards the Lord thy God, he accepts of the Will for the Deed, of the day of ſmall things; <hi>he will not quench the ſmoaking flax, nor break the bruiſed reed;</hi> to whom little is given, of them little is requir'd: the widow's mite is a great deal in the account of God. Therefore think and judg of thy ſelf not according to any thing inherent in thee, be it more or leſs, but according to the meaſure of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance thou haſt with God; 'tis his <hi>kindneſs that makes thee great,</hi> 2 Sam. 22.36. <hi>his favour is better than life;</hi> if he hath wrought that in thee which is beautiful in his fight, why ſhould you ſo much except againſt his workmanſhip, as to blot all out again, drawing the black lines of diſmal deſpair upon the comely features of true and ſaving hope, though weak and ſmall for the preſent? the high eſteem God hath of the loweſt degree of true grace in his Saints, ſhould make them not to droop ſo much under it, but rather be better pleaſed with what God is ſo well pleaſed with.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Conſider how ill God takes it of his children, when they ſuffer them
<pb n="606" facs="tcp:95740:311"/> ſelves to be perſwaded by the Devil out of all good liking and eſteem of thoſe ſmaller meaſures of grace, that God hath given them; when they are brought out of conceit of themſelves, and of every thing that God hath done for them, as if their caſe were now deſperate. <hi>Why ſaiſt thou, O</hi> Jacob, <hi>and ſpeakeſt, O</hi> Iſrael, <hi>my way is hid from the Lord, and my judgment is paſſed over from my God?</hi> Iſa. 40.27. Let me ſpeak my thoughts out: My brethren, to deny the leaſt meaſure of grace in us, or to us, againſt plain demonſtrations and evidences brought to convince us of it, is a kind of denying Chriſt himſelf, which we would be loath to be guilty of for a thouſand worlds; and yet, may not Chriſt ſay? I have ſent in proviſion into ſuch a ſoul, and have often invited my ſelf to come and ſup with him; I have come into my gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to gather my myrrh, and to eat of my pleaſant fruits, which my own hand had planted there, <hi>Cantic.</hi> 5.1. But I had no entertainment, no welcome, they would be known of nothing that ever they had from me, plead no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but poverty, and bare walls; and did I not know it to be otherwiſe, that I have laid in a ſufficiency of grace, and that there is that in the houſe which I love, and could feed heartily upon, I ſhould not take it ill that they ſet nothing before me; but 'tis great unkindneſs not to give me of my own, not to entertain me at my own coſt, but to tell me to my face, that all my fruit is rotten fruit, all my meat unſavoury meat, all my wine adulterated wine, nothing fit for them or me to feed upon, all is ſtark nought, they are never the better for any thing I have yet done for them, to ſeek of every thing, their faith is dead, their hope is preſumption, or elſe quite vaniſhed into deſpair, their love is cold and falſe, every grace is counterfeit, Chriſt muſt needs take this very ill: many of the Children of God are greatly guilty in this thing. I would preſs this conſideration upon thoſe who do too too much indulge themſelves in theſe deſpondencies, ſtill multiplying ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections againſt themſelves, and meditating evaſions how to put off Chriſt and the promiſes, how to diſtinguiſh themſelves out of the favour of God. I know there is a great deal of pity and commiſeration due to ſuch, but when other meanes will not prevail, they muſt not take it ill, if we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to fright them out of their fears and doubts, telling them plainly what an offence, what an affront it is to Chriſt, to have all his kindneſſes overlook'd and ſlighted as nothing worth by a froward, habitual, querulous ſcrupuloſity, which is jealous of every thing but it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6. When the Devil is urging thee to conclude thy weak hope to be down-right Deſpair, inſtead of diſputing with the Devil about the truth of any grace, labour through the help of the Spirit to act it in that degree which thou haſt attained; then if it be as a grain of muſtard-ſeed, it will remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains; 'tis not imaginable what great things a little grace will do, when ſtirr'd up and acted; the ſtrength of God is in it: <hi>out of the mouths of babes and ſucklings he ordains ſtrength,</hi> Pſal. 8.12. The ſmalleſt degree of true grace is able to ſecure it ſelf againſt the gates of hell, at leaſt ſo far as to prevent a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal overthrow: Nay let me ſay further (though with ſubmiſſion) <hi>I am perſwaded that never any child of God fell before a temptation, under the actual exerciſe of that meaſure of grace,</hi> (be it more or leſs) that God hath given him to withſtand it. I do not Arminianize upon <hi>facienti quod in ſe eſt,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:95740:311"/> I ſpeak not of the power of nature, but true grace acted to the higheſt degree of attainment, 'tis that which does great things, and hath the bleſſing; <hi>he that is faithful in a little, ſhall be ruler over much;</hi> but if the good man ſlumber and ſleep, no wonder if the enemy break in upon him: when we are putting forth our ſelves to the utmoſt in any conflicts with Satan, <hi>God with the temptation will find out a way of eſcape, that we may be able to bear it,</hi> 1 Cor. 10.13. <hi>in that very hour it ſhall be given,</hi> Mark 13.11. Mat. 10.19. when we ſeem to be ſurpriz'd and over-matched by a temptation, God will come in with more ſtrength, and out of weakneſs we ſhall become ſtrong, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.34. thus little <hi>David</hi> overcomes great <hi>Goliah</hi> with a ſling and a ſtone: the Devil him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf flyes from the Children of God, when they reſiſt him in the ſtrength of that grace they have.—<hi>to him that hath, ſhall be given, the weak ſhall be as David, and David</hi> as God <hi>(vel,</hi> as the Angel of God.)</p>
               <p>Many times weak Chriſtians don't put forth that ſtrength which they have: would they but <hi>lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees,</hi> Heb. 12.12. their ſpirits would return, and their courage would increaſe, and ſomething might be done: but alas! they give way to their fears, and deſpair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoughts, lye flat upon the ground, and give up all for loſt; they don't attend to the actings of their hope whileſt it goes by another name, all is deſpair, as good never a whit, as never the better; 'tis to no purpoſe for them to do any thing, they are paſt recovery, undone for ever. O, my brethren, don't give the Devil ſuch an advantage againſt you, but ſet your ſelves to act that grace you have, be it never ſo little, look among the aſhes, blow up the leaſt ſparks you ſee; you don't know how ſoon it may break out into a flame; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member this, that <hi>repeated acts of weak grace are equivalent to ſtrong grace, both as to thy ſucceſs, and God's acceptation;</hi> who requires no more of thee, than what is proportionable to that which he hath given to thee.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Conſider, that all graces are joyn'd with their contraries in this ſtate of imperfection here below; no faith but is unequally yoked with ſome unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, no hope without ſome deſpair and deſponding: <hi>that which is perfect is not yet come, and that which is imperfect is not yet done away:</hi> we are fleſh as well as ſpirit, and they two are contraries: As there is ſome kind of hope in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, ſo there may be ſome kind of deſpair in hope; no degree of true Chriſtian hope is conſiſtent with the damning ſin of final deſpair; but ſome degrees of deſpondency, and that which thou calleſt deſpair, and which in a degree is ſo, may be conſiſtent with ſaving hope; and ſo it holds true in all other graces, from that mixture of corruption wherein the weakneſs of every grace doth lye, yet grace is grace ſtill, hath all its eſſential parts, and deſerves not that nick-name which thou putteſt upon it; all dimneſs is not ſtark blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, every cloud doth not make mid-night; what muſt you have all or none? 'tis indeed a ſign of ſincerity to covet all grace, and as true a ſign of humility and ſubmiſſion to the will of God thankfully to accept of a little, owning thoſe firſt fruits of the Spirit, which in due time will be ſeconded with an after increaſe to thy plenary content and ſatisfaction; our heavenly Father waters every plant of his own planting, that it may bring forth more fruit: therefore do not call every weak act of Hope, deſpair, do not call every fit of deſpair, final deſpair: what if the Sun be ſet, muſt it never riſe more? if thou
<pb n="608" facs="tcp:95740:312"/> art caſt down, art thou utterly forſaken? if mercy is at preſent gone out of thy ſight, muſt it be clean gone for ever? theſe are but the breakings out of thoſe peccant humours, that will be predominant ſometimes in the beſt of men.</p>
               <p>By what hath been ſaid, we may anſwer thoſe Objections, which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil makes againſt our hope from the weakneſs of it.</p>
               <p>I have but one thing more to add by way of direction to weak Believers, who are never in more danger of being drawn into deſpair, than when they are muſing upon their ſins, examining and judging themſelves by the Law; charging themſelves home with all that guilt that lyes upon them, in order to their further humiliation in the ſight of God; then does the Devil many times ſtrike in and ſuggeſt ſuch frightful conſiderations to them, that make them ſtart back further than God would have them: Therefore I ſhall now ſhew, how we ſhould prepare our ſelves for, how we ſhould order and manage our ſelves under a deep and ſerious conſideration of our ſins and unworthyneſs, which we are called to, and it is requiſite (the ſwelling temper of our proud hearts requiring it) ſometimes to ſet our ſelves apart for this work, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12.</p>
               <p>The Direction is this, Take down along with thee into the Valley of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, contrition, and ſelf-abhorrency, ſo much of a ſenſe of Gods love and free grace in Chriſt, as may keep thee from being overwhelm'd, and from ſinking into deſpair; before you ſet out be ſure you have ſome hold (at leaſt of the hemm) of the garment of Chriſts righteouſneſs; you know not what foul weather, what ſtorms and tempeſts, what thunder and lightning you may meet with before you return; carry your cordial along with you, though you never ſmell to it, or taſt it, but in a fainting fit: my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is, you ſhould take (at leaſt) ſome general view of mercy before you take a ſtrict particular view of ſin: uſually they are the deepeſt and trueſt hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliations, that are occaſion'd by ſome previous ſenſe of Gods love to us, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.61, 63.</p>
               <p>A man that is to go down into a deep pit, he does not throw himſelf head-long into it, or leap down at all adventures, but faſtens a rope at top upon a croſs beam, or ſome ſure place, and ſo lets himſelf down by degrees: So, let thy ſelf down into the conſideration of thy ſin, hanging upon Chriſt, and when thou art gone ſo low that thou canſt endure no longer, but art ready to be overcome with the horror and darkneſs of thy miſerable eſtate, dwell not too long at the gates of hell, leſt the devil pull thee in, but wind thy ſelf up again by renewed acts of faith, and <hi>fly for refuge unto the hope that is ſet before thee,</hi> Heb. 6.18. And all the way thou goeſt admire the infinite grace and love of God to thee in delivering thee from ſo great a death. My brethren, there's no entring into the maze and labyrinth of ſin without this clew in your hands. Solitary conſiderations of ſin, if we dwell too long upon them, will work too violently: therefore we ſhould make frequent tranſitions from ſin to free grace, from the Law to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, from our miſerable and wretched ſelves, to our merciful and mighty Redeemer—But you'l ſay, how can this be? to paſs from one contrary paſſion to another, who can make ſuch tranſitions? The Schools tell us, it muſt be <hi>per magnum conatum,</hi> by ſome great endeavour, that is a ſtrain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ordinary, and ſuch endeavours we muſt put forth, counting it as
<pb n="609" facs="tcp:95740:312"/> much our duty to rejoyce in mercy, as to mourn for ſin, and we cannot do both at once: though there be a connexion of divine Graces as well as moral vertues, yet this implies rather a ſucceſſive continuation, than any ſimultaneouſneſs (at leaſt) as to the intenſe actings of different graces: 'tis true, where there is one grace, there is every grace, that is, <hi>in ſemine,</hi> in the ſeed or root of it, and it may be alſo, as to ſome weaker, latent, actual influences; yet thoſe particular graces which upon different diſtinct conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations do work contrary paſſions in us, they cannot be both intenſely acted at the ſame time, <hi>ſed per vices &amp; intervalla:</hi> there is a time to mourn, and a time to rejoyce, a time to fear, and a time to hope, particular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces do take their turns in the ſoul, and act ſutably unto the preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Direction againſt deſpair for unbelievers convinced of ſin, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with Chriſt and free Grace. The diſtraction, fear, and amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſpirit that ſeizes upon ſuch is unexpreſſible; till God break in upon them, and begin with them, ſpeaking peace to them, man can do little, yet means muſt be uſed. I ſhall name a few things.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Look upon this conviction of ſin thou lyeſt under, rather as a mercy than a judgement, as a token for good, in as much as God hath given thee timely notice of thy danger, and fair warning to flee from the wrath to come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Look upon thy ſelf now in a far greater capacity for grace and pardon than ever heretofore.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Set thy ſelf with all ſeriouſneſs to ſtudy the doctrine of free grace in Chriſt, never more need than now, meditate much upon the great goodneſs of God, and his excellent loving kindneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 31.19. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.6. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe thoughts of ſin, and ſlight perfunctory thoughts of mercy drive us to deſpair.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Be perſwaded to come to Chriſt under all thy fears. Haſt thou been as a Dove of the valley, mourning on the mountains for thy iniquity, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 7.16. come down from thoſe mountains, thoſe ſolitary places, and go weeping to the Lord, <hi>Jer.</hi> 50.4.</p>
               <p>Bemoan thy ſelf at the feet of Chriſt, he will hear thee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.18, 19. tell God all thou haſt to ſay of thy miſerable condition: complaining to thy ſelf and to men ſignifies little, it heightens thy fear, but God ſympathizes with thee, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.20. put thy ſelf into his hands, he will lead thee, <hi>ver.</hi> 9. refreſhing will come from the preſence of the Lord, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. there will be a lifting up, <hi>Job</hi> 22.29. what ever the iſſue be, thou canſt be no worſe than thou art in thy own judgement; to ſin is <hi>mors animae,</hi> but to deſpair is <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcendere in infernum;</hi> ſin is death, and deſpair is hell; cry out of the belly of that hell to Chriſt, and ſee if he do not bring thee forth.</p>
               <p>But alas! thoſe who are under a ſpirit of bondage and fear, have a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand objections againſt this I have been preſſing them to: I ſhall go over ſome of theſe and anſwer them as I go.— they come to Chriſt? they'l tell us;</p>
               <p>They cannot come.</p>
               <p>Tell the Lord then thou art willing to come, but canſt not be perſwaded to
<pb n="610" facs="tcp:95740:313"/> come as thou canſt; canſt thou not go into thy chamber, into thy cloſet, and ſhut thy door, and throw thy ſelf down in the duſt before the Lord? this is coming, and this thou canſt do I am ſure: do it then, and call upon the name of the Lord. But,</p>

Chriſt came not <hi>to the whole, but to the ſick, not to call the righteous, but ſinners to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> even the greateſt of ſinners, and ſince thou takeſt thy ſelf to be ſo, obey this loud call, and come immediately to Chriſt, though thy ſins be as ſcarlet, and as crimſon, they ſhall be as white as ſnow and as wool, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. therefore turn thee to thy God, and wait continually on him, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 12.6. <hi>etiam cum ad culmen perveneris omnium peccatorum,</hi> as <hi>Zanch.</hi> upon the place, <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>de relig.</hi> when thou art come to the height of all ſin and wickedneſs.

<pb n="612" facs="tcp:95740:314"/> them as an anſwer from God to thee; and make thy beſt of them as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.81. <hi>My ſoul fainteth for thy ſalvation, but I hope in thy word:</hi> hath not Chriſt ſaid? <hi>John</hi> 6.37. <hi>Him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe caſt out:</hi> if he ſhould never ſpeak one word more to thee all thy dayes, here is enough ſaid already to ſupport thee: we ſay <hi>omne praeteritum eſt neceſſarium,</hi> that which is paſt can never be recall'd, Chriſt will never unſay what is paſs'd out of his lips; keep thy hold here, and thou art ſafe to eternity. Nothing but raptures and particular revelations, ſome ſtrong ſenſible feelings of comfort will ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie ſome, whereas indeed God hath revealed his whole counſel to us in the Scriptures, and has nothing more to ſay to ſinners, than what is already expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Goſpel: the particular anſwers that God gives his people ſometimes, what are they but inward repetitions of Goſpel-promiſes to the heart, ſealed up there by the Spirit?</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Queſtion, which this Text was choſen to reſolve, is, <hi>How a Chriſtian may get ſuch a Faith, as is not only ſaving at the laſt, but comfortable, and joyful at preſent?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This caſe hath two things in it; one it takes for granted, the other it doth ſuppoſe may, and ſometimes doth come to paſs: it takes (firſt) for granted, that joy and comfort ariſe from Faith, <hi>(viz.)</hi> Faith unfeigned (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks,) which purifies the heart, and ſets love a work to obey the Law, and ſo the commandment hath the end for which it was made, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.5. and this is very ſure, for all comfort muſt begin in God, and be derived from him, he is the <hi>father of mercies, and the God of all comfort,</hi> 2 Cor. 1.3. and he hath given us <hi>everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations through grace,</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. <hi>laſt.</hi> but it is not from God abſolute, or without a Mediator, alas there is no comfort in that! What comfort can a malefactor that hath myriads of inditements againſt him upon the file, the leaſt whereof muſt take away his life, expect from a juſt and righteous judge? the caſe is thine and mine, infinitely more dreadful than between a malefactor and a magiſtrate: my ſins are innumerable, the leaſt is mortal, God is judge; and hell is the priſon; wrath, horrour, fire, the worm, and all endleſs, that is the puniſhment; the judge is, and cannot be otherwiſe than moſt true and righteous, what comfort can I think to find now from God abſolute, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> without relation to Chriſt? behold inſtead of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, a devouring flame, and inſtead of joy, a conſuming fire. I ſpeak this becauſe of abundance of our people, they ſay God is merciful, and they do their beſt, they hope God will be their comfort, and they ſerve him, and all this while they think not of Jeſus Chriſt: we are all naturally So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians, thoſe that never heard their names, much leſs read their books, live in their heretical and blaſphemous principles. O the amazing ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of the world, called Chriſtian, that we can ſmile and laugh, and hug our ſelves in deceiving comforts upon the brink of hell! there can be nothing comfortable to us, without the God of all comfort, and no
<pb n="614" facs="tcp:95740:315"/> comfort can be to us from God, but by the Lord Jeſus; and no Jeſus to us without Faith; <hi>we rejoyce in God,</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) but how? <hi>by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,</hi> why? by <hi>him we have received the attonement,</hi> he hath made it by his blood, and we receive it by Faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.11. he is the Salvation of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.30. and the conſolation of <hi>Iſrael, verſe</hi> 25. he is our comfort by being God's Salvation. That the buſineſs of Chriſt in the world was to teach us no more humbling precepts than <hi>Plato</hi> or <hi>Moſes,</hi> and then to ſeal them with his death, there is little comfort; this comfort and joy is the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, 'tis wrought by the bleſſed Spirit, joy in or by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is joy, Gal.</hi> 5.22. 'tis joy in the Father by the Mediator, through the Comforter: this tells that joy and comfort are noble and divine goods, they are not little debonnaires, or complacency with ſome faceti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or gentle garb, that is but thin and beggarly, nor are they friends to a ſowr face and cloudy countenance, 'twas inward comfort that made <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen's</hi> face to ſhine as an Angel, this joy is not a joy in the face and not in the heart, as ſome did rejoyce, who put on a good face under the ſtrokes of an angry conſcience, and reproached <hi>Paul</hi> for a frantick, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.13.</p>
            <p>Neither is this comfort a floating thing in the mouth; when perſons with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out good cauſe are prating their aſſurance, and comfort, it ſeems to argue too much froth, and lightneſs, <hi>(res ſevera</hi> (ſaith <hi>Seneca) eſt verum gaudium,</hi> the richeſt mines lye deep, and the deepeſt rivers <hi>minimo labuntur ſono</hi> make the leaſt noiſe,) but it is marrow and fatneſs to the ſoul, <hi>the joy of the Lord is your ſtrength.</hi> I cannot expreſs the excellency of it, the Text ſaith it is <hi>joy unſpeakable, and full of glory.</hi> The ſum is this, a Chriſtian, that would live comfortably, muſt live holily, if he will live holily, he muſt live ſo pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marily by the faith of the Son of God, and he muſt endeavour after ſuch a degree of faith as to ſay, <hi>Chriſt loved me, and gave himſelf for me, Gal.</hi> 2.20. that comfort in life, and to, and in death, is the joy of Faith, the victory of Faith, the triumph of Faith, <hi>all joy and peace in believing, Rom.</hi> 15.13. a ſpecial application of the righteouſneſs of Chriſt to a man's own ſoul, there is the riſe and origine of joy and comfort, if the Scripture may take place.</p>

               </label> The clean contrary is moſt true, it is the only way to bring all good works and all comfort into the world, a man not ſanctified by Faith in Chriſt cannot do a good work, but ſpoils it in the doing, neither can he ſee a comfortable day, while he is ſuch, this objection is hugely ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rational, a man may as well argue againſt marriage, and ſay that marriage is the ready way to drive all lawful ſeed out of the world, and bring in baſtards, it is the ſame caſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. or he might as well plead againſt the riſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Sun, and ſay it was the way to drive all light out of the world, and to bring in darkneſs, 'tis the ſame caſe, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. he may as well ſay, that eating of bread is the way to drive out all vigour and ſtrength of the body out of the world, the way to bring in ſtarvedneſs, it is ſtill the ſame caſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.54. the truth is, Children before marriage are ſpurious,
<pb n="615" facs="tcp:95740:315"/> the world without the Sun is darkneſs, and without eating no living, ſo without union to and intereſt in Chriſt Jeſus, who is <hi>Jehovah</hi> our righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, there is no holineſs or comfort in the world. To ſet up any thing for righteouſneſs in the ſight of God but the righteouſneſs of Jeſus, that is the way indeed to drive the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all the Reformed Churches, with all their moſt eminent Doctrines out of the world, nay to drive all good works and all comfort out of the world, nay to drive the Goſpel and Chriſt and Salvation by him out of the world; if the <hi>Galatians,</hi> that were profeſſed believers, received <hi>Paul</hi> as an Angel, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Spirit, ſhall turn aſide to their own works, and make them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>current with Chriſt, though but as a leſs principal part (which was their caſe) then mark the iſſue, the grace of the Father is fruſtrated, the death of Chriſt is in vain, <hi>fruſtra ſine fructu, Gal.</hi> 2.21. Chriſt is of none effect, <hi>they are fallen from Grace, Chriſt profits them nothing:</hi> and all this <hi>Paul</hi> doth teſtifie with a great deal of vehemence and Solemnity, once and again, and with ſuch Apoſtolical majeſty, as ſeldom occurs, <hi>Behold I</hi> Paul <hi>teſtifie unto you, Gal.</hi> 5.2, 3, 4. I ſuppoſe that no man that underſtands <hi>Paul</hi> will ſay, that he diſputes only againſt the ceremonial Law: therefore I will leave it, and conclude this with that, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.12. <hi>he that hath the Son hath life, he that hath not the Son hath not life,</hi> and this is written to them that believe, that they might know that they have eternal life, and they that know it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not altogether want this in my Text, <hi>joy unſpeakable and glorious.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſecond thing in the queſtion is ſuppoſed, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that a Chriſtian may have Faith that is ſaving in the end, which is not comforting in the way. I Anſw. 1. You muſt not ſo underſtand it, as though ſaving Faith and comforting were two kinds of Faith, nor ſecondly, as if ſaving Faith in the cloſe were in ſome believers altogether, and always void of all light and comfort, but how a Chriſtian, who is ſaved when he dies, may live comfortably while he lives, then the reſolution of the caſe is this, that, that Faith which is ſaving in the end, is alſo ſanctifying in the way, and would be comfortable alſo, if the Chriſtian did not <hi>Ponere obicem,</hi> hinder it him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and therefore that he may live joyfully, he muſt remove theſe hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drances, and uſe the means proper to the end, of which anon: at preſent he muſt do as theſe believers in the Text did, and he ſhall find comfort as they did, in theſe four particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They did perſiſt in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, as it is in Chriſt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. falſe Apoſtles, deceitful workers, transforming themſelves into the Miniſters of Chriſt began then, <hi>v.</hi> 13. <hi>Paul</hi> was jealous of the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> leſt that chaſt Virgin ſhould be corrupted, <hi>v.</hi> 2. as the Churches in <hi>Galatia</hi> were bewitched with theſe juglers, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. the great deſign of the old ſerpent from that day to this hath been to adulterate the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of faith in a crucified Redeemer, knowing full well that this is the moſt effectual courſe to ruine all true holineſs and ſolid comfort.</p>
            <p>But theſe believers received the grace of God in truth, as it was fully and plainly propoſed to them, they did not ſpin out the high and vital truths into needleſs diſputes, nor darken them with nice diſtinctions, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinctions, this ſerves for little elſe but to diſtract the mind, and diſturb the quiet of mens ſouls.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="616" facs="tcp:95740:316"/>2. They did <hi>taſte that the Lord</hi> (viz.) Chriſt <hi>is gracious,</hi> to whom coming as the living ſtone, they as lively ſtones were built upon him a ſpiritual houſe for God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4, 5. they did not content themſelves with ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxy, to reſt ſatisfied in this, that they were not <hi>Simonians,</hi> or <hi>Ebionites,</hi> or <hi>Menandrians,</hi> or the ſectators of them that did deſtroy Chriſt's righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, by dividing it: let us not only profeſs Chriſt, but feel him; <hi>'tis one thing to preach Chriſt and another thing to feel him,</hi> were the laſt words of Mr. <hi>Aſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. They minded the myſtery of the Goſpel, the eternal Deity, grace, and righteouſneſs of our Lord Jeſus, as <hi>Peter</hi> prayed for them, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and exhorts them to grow in this, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>laſt.</hi> as for Church modes and memberſhip, and priviledges, they did enjoy them without cenſuring and animoſity, but knowledge of and communion with Jeſus Chriſt accompanied with love, and obedience, and peace of conſcience, was the main buſineſs of their life, this is the way to comfort, let us do ſo. Aſſure your ſelves there is little joy in a ceremony to a dying man; modes and memberſhip are but ſorry comforters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> As they had Faith and Love, ſo they did exerciſe them, they did believe, and they did go on to believe, and ſo to be acquainted with the righteouſneſs of God <hi>from Faith to Faith:</hi> you may obſerve how the Apoſtle remembers the works of Faith, Love, and Patience, in Chriſt of the <hi>Theſſal.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.3. and in the 2. <hi>Epiſtle, cap.</hi> 1. <hi>verſe</hi> 3. He thanks God their Faith did grow exceedingly, there was but a little time between the writing of theſe two Epiſtles, this latter being written ſhortly after the firſt, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie their miſtake about the day of Chriſt. The primitive Chriſtians did not content themſelves with habits, and let them be as fire under the aſhes, or as ſeed under the clods, but did ſtir them up that they might warm, and they did water them that they might ſpring, and bloſſom like a roſe. If a man that hath the power of ſeeing ſhould walk up and down the ſtreets from morning to night with his eyes ſhut, without any actual ſeeing, would you not ſuſpect him to be diſtempered? what comfort can this man take in the light of the Sun? much like this is a believer that hath Faith habitual, he riſeth in the morning, and lyes down at night, and hath not an act of Faith upon, nor a privy thought of bleſſing Jeſus all the day; how can any comfort be expected in ſuch a ſtrangeneſs as this is?</p>
            <p>So then the ſum is this, theſe believers received the Goſpel of Salvation by Chriſt, pure as it was propoſed to them, they gave the Apoſtle this honour, that they had wiſdom enough to expreſs themſelves plainly, fully, ſignificantly; and honeſty enough, that they would not deal fallaciouſly, or ambiguouſly, they valued not the tradition of their fathers, nor the fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Philoſophers, they had no vain janglings amongſt themſelves, but coveted the ſincere unmixed milk of the word that they might grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.1, 2.</p>
            <p>The Goſpel came to them not in word only, <hi>but in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance,</hi> Aſſurance of underſtanding, aſſurance of Faith: their communion was with the Father, and fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt, that made their joy to be rich and plentiful: their priviledges and ordinances
<pb n="617" facs="tcp:95740:316"/> were their <hi>delight,</hi> but not their <hi>confidence,</hi> they came to God by them, and waited upon God in them in dangerous times, for the enlarging and confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their knowledge, Faith, and comfort: let us be exhorted to do as they did, and doubtleſs we ſhall ſpeed as they ſped. My buſineſs now is to ſpeak ſomething to the Text, and then more to the practical caſe in hand, only firſt I would crave leave to ſpeak a few words to the context; for this reaſon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as my Text is the true pourtraiture of <hi>practical</hi> godlineſs, ſo the context gives us a ſyſtem of <hi>godlineſs doctrinal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Epiſtle is written to the ſtrangers, <hi>v.</hi> 2. Jews and Gentiles, (ſay ſome) but eſpecially Jews ſcattered in four now Roman provinces, not long before di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and conſiderable Kingdoms together with <hi>Aſia, ſc.</hi> the proconſular or leſs <hi>Aſia,</hi> yet including alſo thoſe parts in and about <hi>Chaldea: Peter</hi> was at this time in or about <hi>Babylon,</hi> in which parts were many myriads of the Jews, of whom he was the Apoſtle with <hi>James</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> Gal. 2.9. 1 Pet. 5.13. That <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi> in the Text ſhould myſtically be <hi>Rome</hi> is a mere conceit, and a groundleſs fancy, this Epiſtle was written thirty years at leaſt before <hi>John</hi> had received the revelation, <hi>Grotius</hi> and others are quite beſide the truth, 'tis forty to one odds that <hi>Peter</hi> was never there; well, theſe Jews were effectually called, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods election; the <hi>terminus</hi> or the thing to which, not for which, or upon which, but to which they were choſen and called, is ſaid to be this: <hi>ſc.</hi> to <hi>obedience and ſprinkling of the blood of Jeſus;</hi> the great efficient of this in them is the bleſſed Spirit, <hi>through the ſanctification of the Spirit;</hi> the ſame <hi>verſe:</hi> being thus ſanctified, they had hope, where obſerve, the property of this hope, it was <hi>a lively hope.</hi> 2. The term or object, an <hi>inheritance.</hi> 3. The way whereby they obtained this hope, they were <hi>begotten of God</hi> as a father to it. 4. The cauſe moving God to this, his <hi>abundant mercy.</hi> 5. The ground of this hope, it was the <hi>reſurrection of Chriſt</hi> from the dead, then the fruit of it, which was <hi>great joy, v.</hi> 3. And then 6. here is their perſeverance, and how that is effected, they were <hi>kept</hi> by the <hi>power</hi> of God to Salvation, <hi>v.</hi> 5. No doubt but holineſs is loſeable, the Angels loſt theirs, and we loſt ours, and the Saints at this day would quickly loſe theirs totally and finally, if they were left to a ſtock of grace received, to trade for another world; to grace received there muſt be grace ſupplyed, the grounds of perſeverance are without us: <hi>viz.</hi> the promiſe of the Father, the purchaſe and interceſſion of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, the power and ſupply of the bleſſed Spirit, a Doctrine full of <hi>comfort,</hi> but for certain, as full of grace and <hi>humility</hi> too, indeed if the comfort were not ſanctifying it were not found.</p>
            <p>So that here we may ſee the Doctrine of the glorious Trinity, and every perſon in his work, according to the moſt wiſe, and divine <hi>Oeconomy,</hi> and propriety in working towards fallen men quite dead in ſin, and dead in law, and that irreco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verably as to themſelves, or any created power in heaven on their behalf, here is, I ſay, the Father electing to life and glory, here is Jeſus Chriſt dying and riſing, here is the bleſſed Spirit ſanctifying, here the three Graces, Faith, Hope, and Love, inſeparably accompanyed with obedience, cheriſhed with joy and comforts, and crowned with perſeverance by the power of God, all ariſing from the Soveraignty of God's will, and his rich abundant mercy, to the praiſe of the riches of his glorious grace, that they that glory ſhould glory in the

               </gap> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold temptations, <hi>v.</hi> 6, 7. perſecutions in a tumultuary way were raiſed againſt them by the unbelieving Jews, who were egged thereto by the Prieſts, Prieſts who did ſtir up the people againſt them, there was no Imperial Edict at this time againſt the Chriſtians. <hi>Nero</hi> was the firſt, he was <hi>dedicator damnationis noſtrae;</hi> I need not quote <hi>Tertullian,</hi> every Lad of the upper form may know this out of <hi>Suetonius</hi> and <hi>Tacitus.</hi> God kept the Goſpel in the firſt publiſhing of it free from any diſturbance by the civil powers about 34 years; that <hi>Clau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> baniſhed <hi>John</hi> into <hi>Patmos,</hi> and that then he had the revelation is a mere figment of the learned <hi>Grotius,</hi> and his Annotations built upon it have neither ſap nor ſenſe.</p>
            <p>Under theſe perſecutions their Faith did not only continue but ſhine, and their love was evident, and their comforts were ſo far from abating, that they did rejoyce with joy unſpeakable and glorious.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, what is this to the queſtion? I anſwer, here are two di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how a Chriſtian may get that Faith, whereby he may live comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably as well as die ſafely.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Be clothed with humility, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.5. aſcribe all thy gifts, and graces, thy profiting under afflictions, ordinances, thy peace and comfort, wholly to the grace of God by Jeſus Chriſt through the Spirit of holineſs. If there be any way in the world to get ſpecial Faith, and to live comfortably, it is this, to live humbly; the evangelically humble ſoul is the ſerene chearful ſoul; heart-pride doth not only deprive believers of comfort, but brings vexations, diſappointments, and diſguſts, which are a torment to pride where ever it is; 'tis a ſin that is very incident, very pleaſing to us, very diſpleaſing to God, and very diſquieting; 'tis an eaſie thing to preach, and hear, and diſcourſe humility, but believe it, it is not ſo eaſie to live it; a man's ſoul is never ſo fit to receive the ſhines of Gods love, as when he is nothing in himſelf, be ſure to cruſh the ſprawlings and motions of this curſed pride, ſee God in all, bleſs him for all, ſee the Lord Jeſus the purchaſer of all, and the bleſſed Spirit the Sanctifier of all, ſtudy this well, and live that Text in <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. <hi>laſt.</hi> God is <hi>Principium, efficiens, &amp; finis; of him, through him, and for him, are all things,</hi> give him the glory, reduce this to practice, this is every day practicable, and were it practiſed, would make every day comfortable, envyings and provokings ariſe from vain-glory, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. <hi>laſt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de nata ſunt ſchiſmata, quippe</hi> (Hierome) <hi>cum dicunt homines nos juſtificamus im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pius, nos ſanctificamus immundos,</hi> we would be ſome-bodies, away with theſe thoughts, let God have the glory, and thou wilt have the comfort; in this way God will give Faith ſpecial, and that is the Faith that brings comfort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The way to comfort is to do as theſe believers in my Text did, they did chooſe rather to forego their earthly comforts than their conſciences, made choice of affliction rather than iniquity, eſteemed the reproaches of Chriſt rather than their ſafety, priſons are not ſo terrible as they are ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:95740:317"/> the beſt men have rejoyced in the honour of ſuffering, they ſuffered joyfully the ſpoiling of their goods, all patience and long-ſuffering with joyfulneſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.11. Scripture-Hiſtory primitive and modern abound with inſtances of all Sexes, Ages, Conditions in this particular. The noble <hi>Galeacius</hi> had that joy in Chriſt at <hi>Geneva</hi> beyond all the Marquiſates in <hi>Italy</hi> or the whole world. In ſuffering comes aſſurance, and that is comfort. You will ſay we are not called to ſuffering; and I ſay the God of peace give us truth and peace always: but then if you would live comfortably, live in religious honeſty, chuſe poverty before knavery, an honeſt meanneſs before ſecretly ſinning gains. Conſcience is the beſt friend next to Jeſus Chriſt. Our rejoycing is this, not that we are Preachers, ſo was <hi>Demas;</hi> nor an Apoſtle, ſo was <hi>Judas;</hi> but <hi>the teſtimony of our conſcience,</hi> that <hi>not in fleſhly wiſdom,</hi> but <hi>in godly ſincerity, through the grace of God we have had our converſation in the world,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Light,</hi> i. e. comfort, <hi>is ſown for the righteous, and joyful gladneſs for the upright, Pſal.</hi> 97.11. Now I come to my Text.</p>
            <p>The words contain the eſſence of Chriſtianity or godlineſs. The conſtituent parts of it are Faith and Love: the neceſſary conſequences are obedience evangelical, and joy unſpeakable. Faith in Jeſus is the great command of the Goſpel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5, <hi>laſt.</hi> 'Tis the work of God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.29. this is <hi>that work.</hi> Love is the great command of the Law, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.36. <hi>Thou ſhall love the Lord thy God with all thy ſoul.</hi> Faith acts upon Jeſus and ſets Love on work. Love deſires after him and delights in him, and ſets obedience on work: divine comfort flows in proportionably. In this is the formal na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſtianity, and what ever is not this in truth is but nature. The revelation left in nature tells us that there is a God, that he is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, that the ſoul is immortal, that there is a ſtate of bliſs in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world, that righteouſneſs is the way to that bliſs. Now as there are but two righteouſneſſes, the righteouſneſs of Chriſt; (of which the whole Creation is ſilent, and nature altogether ignorant, and Angels knew it not until it was revealed to them) and a mans own righteouſneſs: So there are but two Religions in the world, <hi>ſc.</hi> Chriſtianity and nature. Call Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions by what names you liſt, Judaiſm, Turciſm, Paganiſm, Popery, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Proteſtantiſm, 'tis ſtill but nature. The Sea hath many names from the Countries and ſhores, but ſtill it is the ſame Sea. Theſe two righteouſneſſes cannot be mixt in the buſineſs of juſtification in the ſight of God. If it be of Chriſt as the Scripture faith, it is no more of works: if it be of works, as nature ſaith, it is no more of Chriſt: we cannot be juſtified in his ſight partly by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt's obedience, and partly by our own. <hi>The Law is not of Faith,</hi> Gal. 3.13. <hi>as many as are of the works are under the curſe,</hi> v. 10. <hi>the juſt ſhall live by faith, ergo</hi> not by law. This is <hi>Paul</hi>'s Logick, <hi>v.</hi> 11. A man cannot be Son of two mothers. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. <hi>lat. end. Caſt out the bond-woman and her Son, for the Son of the bond-woman ſhall not be heir with the Son of the free-woman.</hi> And a woman cannot be wife to two husbands together, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.4. There is but one ſtrait gate, <hi>Matth.</hi> 7.13. one door, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.9. one way, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.5. one name, <hi>Acts</hi> 4.12. <hi>Paul</hi> is the moſt lively inſtance in this great caſe: while he was alive to the Law, he was dead to Chriſt; and when he was alive to Chriſt, he was dead to the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.19. dead to the Law
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:95740:318"/> as a rule of righteouſneſs, and alive to the Law as a rule of obedience, dead to the Law in point of dependance, and alive to the Law in point of love and practice: his Chriſtianity did ennoble and heighten his morality: he was juſt and ſober, and temperate, blameleſs, while he was a Phariſee; but when he was a believer, he did the ſame things from a noble principle, in a ſpiritual manner, for the right ends: before he did act from himſelf, for himſelf, now from Chriſt and for Chriſt. The deduction from hence is this.</p>
            <p>If we would live in true comfort, we muſt be true Chriſtians. A man may be a Proteſtant, yet not a Chriſtian indeed; a man may be blameleſs, and Chriſtleſs, and by conſequence Godleſs. Remember the parable of the fooliſh Virgins: they were not harlots, profane, but Virgins: they were not perſecutors, or blaſphemers, or malicious, but fooliſh, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſupine, care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, negligent: they had lamps in their hands, but no oyl in their hearts: the parable of the builders, the ſandy believers, of the Kings ſupper, the man that had not on a wedding garment. Indeed moſt of the preaching of the Lord Jeſus tends this way, and theſe parables live to this day, and as much at this day. Let us look to our ſelves, the oyl of Faith and comfort go together, the oyl of holineſs and the oyl of gladneſs, true Chriſtians are anointed with both. Conſider the man that wanted the wedding robe was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned by any at the table, the Lord eſpied him quickly: who would have thought ſuch a profeſſor ſhould go to hell? <hi>bind him hand and foot:</hi> he did pretend to Chriſt, and it was but a pretence. I may diſpute for, preach up Chriſt's righteouſneſs active and paſſive, and the imputation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of according to the Scripture, and the judgement of the beſt learned that ever the Churches have had, and yet I may go about to eſtabliſh mine own; I may lift up Chriſt to you, and pull him down in mine own heart. The ſum is this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nullum bonum ſine ſummo bono,</hi> Auſtin. I will expound it thus, No good work without God, no God without Chriſt, no Chriſt without heart-Faith, no Faith without love, no love without obedience, no ſuch obedience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comfort, <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
               </label> more or leſs. This brings me to the Doctrine, It is the property and practice of believers to love the Lord Jeſus, and to rejoyce in him, and in the hope of eternal life by him.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt, It is their property, they, and all they, and always, and none but they: there is no man in the world that loves God, and the Redeemer Jeſus, but a believer; the Philoſophers were haters of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.30. the Gentiles and their wiſe men, for it is plain that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of them, (not of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> that is an idle conceit) and I am bound to believe <hi>Paul</hi>'s Characters of the Gentiles and their Philoſophers, before <hi>Diogenes, Laertius, Plutarch,</hi> or any man elſe: the Jews hated Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 15.24. the world hated him, <hi>John</hi> 7.7. <hi>Luke</hi> 19.14. <hi>All Goſpel-Atheiſm</hi> (ſaid that incomparable Dr. <hi>Twiſſe) is againſt Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So for joy, there's never a joyful man alive but a believer. Will you ſay that men take pleaſure in their ſins? why, that is the <hi>Devil's</hi> joy; or that they rejoyce in full barns, and bags? that is the <hi>Fool's</hi> joy; or that they rejoyce in wine, <hi>i. e.</hi> all dainties that gratifie the palate? that is a <hi>Bedlam</hi> joy. <hi>I have ſaid of mirth, thou art mad.</hi> Read and believe <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 2.3. indeed
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:95740:318"/> from the firſt <hi>v.</hi> to the 11. The whole book, but eſpecially that Chapter, is the divineſt Philoſophy that ever was or will be.</p>
            <p n="2">2. 'Tis their practice, they love the Lord Jeſus in incorruption or ſincerity, <hi>Eph.</hi> 6. <hi>laſt.</hi> The Church, <hi>i. e.</hi> Believers joyntly and ſingly ſay of Jeſus, that he it is whom their ſoul loves, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.7. in the 3. <hi>chap.</hi> the 4 firſt <hi>ver.</hi> we have it four times, and none but that: <hi>I ſought him whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> v. 1. <hi>I will ariſe and ſeek him whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> v. 2. <hi>I ſaid to the watchmen, ſaw ye him whom my ſoul loveth?</hi> v. 3. after a little <hi>while I found him whom my ſoul loveth,</hi> v. 4. here is no ſupernumerary repetition, every believer's ſoul bears a part in this divine ſong: ſo for joy, that is their practice too, we have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the fleſh, but <hi>rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> which joy in him did plainly flow out of their confidence of an intereſt in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.3. <hi>as ſorrowful yet al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways rejoycing,</hi> 2 Cor. 6.9. <hi>we rejoyce in hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2. <hi>and we rejoyce in God by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> v. 11. with many more Texts to the ſame purpoſe: there need no more, only obſerve, 'tis we rejoyce, 'tis not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Paul</hi> or the Apoſtles, but the <hi>Philippians, Romans,</hi> and ſo all believers, we rejoyce. I ſhall ſpeak ſomething. 1. For the explication of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. 2. For the vindication of the truth. 3. For the reſolution of the caſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. For explication: theſe two affections Love and Joy will be beſt deſcribed by their properties, objects, cauſes. Love is the return of an holy affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to Jeſus Chriſt, with deſires after him, and delight in him, whoſe properties are theſe: 1. 'Tis a <hi>ſoveraign</hi> love: he it is whom the ſoul loveth, as before out of the <hi>Canticles,</hi> chap. 1.7. a <hi>tranſcendent</hi> love, ariſing out of ſome due ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of his own excellency, and thoſe moſt ineſtimable benefits pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by him: he is the <hi>ſtandard-bearer</hi> amongſt ten thouſand, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4.10. as the apple-tree for ſhade, and fruit to the weary travellers, above all the trees of the forreſt, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.3. Saints and Angels are but <hi>ſhrubs</hi> and fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs things to him, they have fruit for themſelves from him, but none for us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is <hi>unſatisfiable</hi> with any thing beſides him: love is a reſtleſs affection, therefore compared to the grave and death, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.6, 7. <hi>amor ſemper quaerit nova;</hi> it cannot ſay I have enough, till it be terminated on Jeſus Chriſt and God by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. 'Tis <hi>ardent;</hi> and therefore it is compared to coals of fire in the Text, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. it is not a flat and faint thing, but it warms and enlarges the heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. 'Tis very <hi>chaſt;</hi> 'tis not to be frighted away by the troubles and affright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world, neither is it to be bribed off by the blandiſhments and allurements of it, <hi>many waters cannot quench it,</hi> and if any would offer all the ſubſtance of his <hi>houſe</hi> to corrupt it, to withdraw it, it would be utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned, <hi>ibid.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. And chiefly it is <hi>obediential:</hi> what would not a man <hi>do</hi> or <hi>ſuffer</hi> for ſuch a Saviour? for ſuch a Salvation as from ſin and hell, and ſuch a Salvation as into grace and eternal glory? it is the <hi>fulfilling of the law,</hi> Rom. 13.10. A man that loves the Lord Jeſus would fulfil every one of his commands, <hi>the law of his God is in his heart,</hi> Pſal. 37.31. and his heart is to the law: there is a kind
<pb n="622" facs="tcp:95740:319"/> of perfection <hi>ſecundum intentionem,</hi> and he goes on gradually <hi>quoad perfectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi> Love makes the yoke eaſie; his commands are not grievous, <hi>i. e.</hi> They are precious: <hi>Oh how I love thy Law!</hi> ſays <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 119.97. <hi>I delight in the Law of God in my inner man,</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 7.22. Try your ſelves by this: compare your ſelves with that of Chriſt in his farewel Sermon, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.15, 21, 23. withal remember and dread that Text, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.22. <hi>If any man love not the Lord Jeſus, i. e.</hi> malign him, oppoſe him, let him be accurſed till the Lord comes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The object of this love, we have it in the Text <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Lord Jeſus, and all of him: he is altogether lovely. A believer loves him as <hi>King,</hi> loves his Laws and inſtitutions, and none but his; loves him as <hi>Prieſt,</hi> in the holineſs of his nature and life, in the ſuffering of his ſoul, and death; how precious is Jeſus? 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. loves him as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> revealing the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of Salvation, the glorious myſtery of the Goſpel hidden from genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, hidden from the wiſe and prudent. Believers love him moſt intimately as a King for holineſs, as a Prieſt for righteouſneſs, and as a Prophet for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. Luſt like the harlot divides him; but love like the true mother will have him whole, as well holineſs to ſave from ſin, as righteouſneſs to ſave from hell.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The cauſe of it is the bleſſed Spirit: <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is love, Gal.</hi> 5.22. <hi>The Lord thy God ſhall circumciſe thy heart, and cauſe thee to love the Lord thy God, Deut.</hi> 30.6. Alas 'tis not in corrupt nature, the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of the fleſh; the beſt in that hedge is enmity; not a bare enemy, but enmity againſt God; 'tis not ſubject, <hi>i. e.</hi> ordinarily, regularly ſubject to his Law, neither can be; there is a <hi>remotio actus</hi> and <hi>poſſe</hi> too, 'tis a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine work.</p>
            <p>The other holy affection is joy: in the Text we have the properties of it.</p>
            <p>Firſt, 'Tis unſpeakable: the joy of harveſt, rich ſpoils, great treaſures, when they are right, <hi>i. e.</hi> when they are derived from God by Jeſus Chriſt, they have their weight, but what are theſe to the joy of a pardon to a trembling and condemned man? and what is this to the joy in Chriſt to a man that underſtands and is ſenſible what damnation is? what hell is? what eternity is? the highneſs, the ſweetneſs, the revivement is indeed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>effable, no man that feels it can find words fully to expreſs it. 2. 'Tis full of glory, <hi>i. e.</hi> (ſay ſome) a ſtander by cannot judge of it. That is true, but is too ſhort, 'tis <hi>initium vitae aeternae,</hi> 'tis <hi>glorificatum gaudium,</hi> 'tis a part of heaven: <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſeems to think that is too much: our preſent comfort (ſaith he) is rather <hi>Solatium praeſentis miſeriae,</hi> than <hi>gaudium futurae beati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudinis,</hi> rather a collation or refreſhment upon our journey, than a ſet meal at our journeys end. What if we ſhould take the word here glorious, for ſtrong, full of glory, full of divine power, a holy joy, an heart-enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy, ſtrong to do, and ſtrong to die? certainly ſin is never more odious, the heart is never more ſoft, the commandements never more precious, the World never more regardleſs, Jeſus never more glorious, than when we humbly rejoyce in the ſenſe of God's love by Jeſus Chriſt, through the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the bleſſed Spirit. If our comforts be not heart-enlarging to love and duty, they may be ſuſpected for unſound.</p>
            <pb n="623" facs="tcp:95740:319"/>
            <p>I will add one property, <hi>viz.</hi> The joy of Believers is ſoul-ſatisfying joy, it fills the heart and every chink of it, it is abundantly, nay victoriouſly ſatisfying the Soul of it ſelf without praying in the help of the Creatures. Light all the candles in the world, and they will not, cannot make it day: let the Sun ariſe, and that will do it without their help. Read <hi>Hab.</hi> 3. the latter end, in our phraſe, our manner of ſpeech it is this, if no bread in the cupboard, nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the purſe, nor Friend to help, <hi>yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, and glory in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Object of this Joy is preſent intereſt in Jeſus, and a lively hope of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, or Glory hoped for: the cauſe efficient is the bleſſed Spirit, <hi>joy in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> i. e. <hi>by him:</hi> the inward inſtrument is Faith, Faith ſpecial, or Aſſurance, Chriſt <hi>loved me, and gave himſelf for me,</hi> Gal. 2.20. The outward inſtrument is the Goſpel, the Angel called it, <hi>Tydings of great joy.</hi> I pray you try again, where is your joy? whence doth it ariſe? upon what is it fixed? of what kind is it? what is the power of it? joy is natural and pleaſing, every man ſeeks it, many there be, that ſay, who will ſhew us any good? they are for ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, palpable good, Corn, Wine, or Oyl, Riches, Honours: here they think to find joy and comfort. Alas they ſeek the living among the dead, they ſuck an empty breaſt. <hi>David</hi> had all this, but he ſought far higher, he was of a more noble and heavenly temper, <hi>lift up the light of thy countenance,</hi> cauſe thy face to ſhine upon thy Servant, that will <hi>put gladneſs into my heart,</hi> Pſal. 4.5.</p>
            <p>Out of theſe premiſſes we conclude that Chriſtianity is a glorious thing: which is the ſecond particular,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>2.</hi> Particular or vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> which I call a Vindication of the Truth. Religion is not a little formality in duties joyned with ſome morality in life; but it conſiſts in the new creature, or Faith working by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. &amp; 6.16. It conſiſts in the exerciſe of Repentance, ſelf-loathing, hatred of Sin as ſuch, (for theſe are neceſſarily implied) Faith actual in Jeſus, love to him, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence before him, communion with God by him, peace and comfort from him, and well grounded hope of eternal life through him; the <hi>ſmell of his garments, Pſal.</hi> 45.8. the <hi>ſavour of his oyntment, Cant.</hi> 1.3. the taſte of his preciouſneſs makes a Believer think he can never do enough for Jeſus. If his Holineſs were as an Angel, and his days as the days of Heaven, yet all were too ſhort, too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle for ſuch a Saviour, the love of Chriſt conſtrains him. He is a debtor to the Spirit, to live after the Spirit, and what ever is not this in truth (there is a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in degrees) is (as you heard before) but nature raiſed, and varniſhed, and modified with diſtinctions, ſtill it is but nature. Waſh and dreſs a Swine as you pleaſe, 'tis a Swine ſtill. The Fathers (when the breaking out of Pelagianiſm made them more ſtudious in the point of grace, and more wary in their expreſſions) have left us their judgment in this caſe: you bring in a kind of doctrine (ſaith <hi>Auſtin</hi> to the Pelagians) that men do righteouſneſs, and pleaſe God without Faith in Chriſt by the Law of nature: this is that for which the Church doth moſt of all deteſt you, <hi>Hoc eſt undè vos maximè Chriſtiana deteſtatur Eccleſia. Lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Cap.</hi> 3. <hi>contr.</hi> Again, (ſaith he) far be it from us to think that <hi>true vertue</hi> ſhould be in any man, unleſs he were <hi>righteous,</hi> and far be it from us to think, that any man ſhould be truly <hi>righteous,</hi> unleſs he did <hi>live by Faith,</hi> for the juſt ſhall <hi>live by Faith, abſit autem &amp; ſit juſtus vere, niſi vivat ex fide:</hi> and again, who would ſay that a man <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abolo

            <p>'Tis moſt evident, there dwelleth no vertue in the minds of ungodly men: their wiſdom is not heavenly but earthly, not from the <hi>Father</hi> of lights, but from the <hi>prince</hi> of darkneſs; <hi>ac ſic vitium, quod putatur virtus,</hi> and ſo that is a vice which is accounted vertue. <hi>Non Deo ſerviunt ſed diabolo,</hi> they ſerve the devil not God, <hi>Proſp.

The Scripture is full and clear, <hi>an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit.</hi> The carnal mind cannot pleaſe God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.7. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.2.3. the Apoſtle doth raiſe his diſcourſe to the higheſt ſtrain, Though I ſpeak with the <hi>tongue</hi> of <hi>Angels,</hi> which no man doth; if I had all <hi>knowledge,</hi> which no man <hi>hath;</hi> if I could move <hi>mountains,</hi> which no man can; if I give all my goods to <hi>feed</hi> the poor, the higheſt <hi>beneficence;</hi> and my body to be burnt, the greateſt <hi>ſuffering;</hi> yet if I have not love, I am no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: he doth not ſay, theſe things are <hi>nothing;</hi> he doth not ſay, knowledge is <hi>nothing,</hi> or giving to the poor is <hi>nothing,</hi> but I am <hi>nothing,</hi> I have no profit, I am a hollow tub, an empty veſſel, I make a noiſe amongſt men while <hi>I live,</hi> and go to hell when <hi>I die.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And according to Scripture and Fathers the doctrine of our Church hath determinated in her thirteenth Article thus, <hi>Works done before the grace of Chriſt and the Inſpiration of his Spirit are not pleaſing to God;</hi> foraſmuch as they <hi>ſpring not from Faith in Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> yea rather for that they are not done, as God hath <hi>commanded</hi> them to be done, we <hi>doubt not but</hi> they have the <hi>nature of ſin:</hi> and this is the judgment of the reformed Churches alſo. Sirs, be ſure you get and exerciſe this Faith unfeigned in Jeſus Chriſt, and love ſincere to him.

<pb n="625" facs="tcp:95740:320"/> think fit to premiſe: firſt, he muſt not only get ſuch a Faith, but he muſt keep it in exerciſe, for without this there is no living comfortably: then, this alſo I premiſe, that to get and keep comfort, or that a Chriſtian may have comfort, two things are neceſſary, <hi>viz.</hi> proportion and propriety; <hi>ex parte objecti,</hi> it muſt be a good proportionable; and then <hi>ex parte ſubjecti,</hi> it muſt be mine: it muſt be commenſurate and <hi>adaequate</hi> to the ſoul, and it muſt be the ſouls own, <hi>tolle meum,</hi> and <hi>tolle gaudium.</hi> The comfort and ſweetneſs of the Goſpel lyes in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouns (as the common ſaying is) as for inſtance; ſuppoſe the conqueſts of <hi>Alexander,</hi> and triumphs of <hi>Pompey,</hi> nay all the world were thine, there is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, 'tis thine; but herein would be no comfort at all to thee, becauſe here is no proportion, no ſutableneſs to an immaterial, vaſt and immortal ſoul; on the other ſide, Chriſt is propoſed to thee, and in him there is proportion, for in him dwelleth all fulneſs, he is an infinite, ſpiritual and eternal good; but what comfort is this without propriety, unleſs he be thine? <hi>my ſpirit rejoyceth in God my Saviour,</hi> Luke 2. <hi>I will rejoyce in the God of my ſalvation,</hi> Hab. 3. <hi>your Father Abraham ſaw my day, and did rejoyce to ſee it:</hi> the plain Engliſh is this, <hi>Abraham</hi> ſaw Jeſus Chriſt in the promiſes, <hi>ſc.</hi> his obedience, and ſufferings, and the glory that came by Chriſt's righteouſneſs, and did apply it to himſelf by Faith, and was aſſured of his intereſt in it, which made him to rejoyce in that ſight.</p>
            <p>Though a Prince may have a legal right to a treaſure hid in the field, yet till it be diſcovered to him, there is no joy: <hi>the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> and ſo we <hi>rejoyce in the hope of the glory of God,</hi> Rom. 5.2, 5. I will not diſpute whether aſſurance be of the nature of Faith: our Reformers were of renown, and other learned men ſince at home and abroad, that are for aſſurance, do not at any hand exclude adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; ſome think that Faith is a mixed habit, adherence and aſſurance are two acts of the ſame Faith, two flowers from the ſame root. 'Tis true, there may be adherence without aſſurance, but it is as true, that there cannot be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance without adherence. If I know and believe that Chriſt died for me, I ſhould ſtick to it <hi>in negotio juſtificationis,</hi> without taking notice of any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent holineſs either in men or Angels: how do the ſtars diſappear at the riſing brightneſs of the Sun, yet no diſparagement to the ſtars at all? But I ſay I will not diſpute, and if I could, it were both unſeaſonable and needleſs; for whether aſſurance be of the nature of Faith, or whether it be an effect of Faith, is all one in this caſe before us, for there muſt be ſomething of aſſurance that muſt bring in joy and comfort.</p>
            <p>The believers here in my Text they loved Chriſt, and in whom after they believed, they did rejoyce with joy unſpeakable: their firſt acts of Faith might be recumbency, afterwards evidence, then joy; ſo the <hi>Epheſians,</hi> after they believed in Chriſt, they were <hi>ſealed with the holy Spirit of promiſe</hi> as an earneſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13, 14, 15. The note of the old learned and pious <hi>Piſcator</hi> is, <hi>unuſquiſque fidelis verus eſt,</hi> not <hi>eſſe poteſt,</hi> or <hi>eſſe debet,</hi> but <hi>eſt certus ſuae ſalutis,</hi> I will name but one Scripture more, 'tis <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.6. <hi>my beloved is mine, and I am his, he feeds among the lillies: my beloved is mine,</hi> there is the Goſpel with its marrow in the heart of a believer, there is aſſurance: <hi>and I am his,</hi> there is the law in the ſame heart, there is obedience: <hi>he feedeth

            <p>Firſt, If you would get Faith, comforting in life as well as ſaving at death, you muſt not ſit down ſatisfied with a bare recumbence on Jeſus Chriſt. Miſtake me not, I do not diſcourage, and I dare not diſparage it. If it be right (as I take that for granted) it is a grace more precious incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably than all treaſures, and happy is the boſom that wears ſo ineſtimable a Jewel. But when Chriſtians ſenſible of their ſin and hell do attain to this, they reſt ſatisfied here. They are told (and that is truth) that their ſtate is ſafe, there they <hi>acquieſce,</hi> ſet up their ſtaff behind the door, and go no further, they do not preſs on for aſſurance, they will rather argue againſt it, thus, <hi>Object.</hi> That aſſurance is not ſo neceſſary. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So neceſſary, what do you mean? is it not commanded? is it not promiſed? is it not purchaſed? is it not attained by the people of God? ſure it is neceſſary to the <hi>vigor</hi> of grace, and to the being of joy and comfort; <hi>be of good comfort, thy ſins are pardoned, Object.</hi> 2. Yea, but many do live and die and do well without it. <hi>Anſw.</hi> Who told you ſo? the Scripture ſaith, <hi>the Spirit himſelf doth bear witneſs with our ſpirits that we are the children of God,</hi> Rom. 8.16. <hi>and we know and believe the love that God hath given us,</hi> 1 John 4.16. with many very many more Texts to that purpoſe. A tempted believer may bear falſe witneſs againſt himſelf: ſure ſuch a poſition as this with mercy upon uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties is not the way to comfort him: the ſure way were to adviſe him to ſee his ſins more, and humble his ſoul more for them, and to ſtudy Jeſus Chriſt, and to come to him more, with the like, and God will return and ſpeak peace: they that ſow in tears ſhall reap in joy.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. But this joy is not ſo neceſſary. <hi>Reſp.</hi> What do you mean again? ſo neceſſary, why? 1. It is frequently commanded, take one Text, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.4. <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord, (i. e.</hi> Chriſt) <hi>always, and again I ſay rejoyce.</hi> 2. It is frequently promiſed, <hi>I will make them joyful in my houſe of prayer,</hi> Iſa. 56.7. <hi>I will ſee you again, and your heart ſhall rejoyce, and your joy no man taketh from you.</hi> 3. It is practiſed frequently, <hi>we rejoyce in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Phil. 3.3. 4. It is often prayed for, <hi>the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing,</hi> Rom. 15.13.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is Chriſt's office to give the <hi>oyl of gladneſs for the ſpirit of heavineſs,</hi> Iſa. 61.3. 6. It is the ſpecial work of the bleſſed Spirit, who is therefore the Comforter. Take the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> in what notion you will, his work is either comforting or tending to comfort. Laſtly, It is the priviledge of the Goſpel-Ordinances to feaſt the ſoul with marrow and fatneſs, and with wine well refined, <hi>i. e. God hath not given us the ſpirit of bondage to fear again,</hi> (as formerly) <hi>but the Spirit of adoption, whereby</hi> (or rather by whom, <hi>i. e. cujus ope) we cry abba Father.</hi> Surely joy and comfort is neceſſary for the meaſures of grace. If you had a child infirm, ſickly, hard-favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and a friend ſhould ſay, this ſtrength, quickneſs, and comelineſs is not ſo neceſſary, your child is alive, is it not? you would think this were hardly ſutable, much leſs comfortable.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 4. A Chriſtian that doth come to, and rely on Chriſt for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="627" facs="tcp:95740:324"/> may have comfort: <hi>Anſw.</hi> yes, but then it muſt be by the way of a practical ſyllogiſm. He that cometh to Chriſt ſhall never periſh, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. but I do ſo, therefore. Here his coming, together with repentance and obedience, which are concomitants, beget evidence, and from thence comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 5. but many good people want this joy and comfort.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> confeſſed; but then it is our own fault: did we uſe the means, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially ſecret duties, meditation, prayer, which we neglect, it would be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> Laſt. But thoſe that do theſe yet are in great darkneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Yea, for ſometime. The holy ſpirit teacheth many leſſons, excellent ones in this School, chiefly theſe three. 1. They learn what diſmal creatures they muſt have been for ever without Jeſus Chriſt. 2. They learn to give a gueſs, what were the unintelligible amazements and conſternatious that were upon the ſoul of Jeſus Chriſt in their room. 3. The bleſſedneſs that comes by Jeſus Chriſt. And when they have learned their leſſons in this School out of the word by this ever bleſſed Tutor, God brings them out with ſilver, joy, and gold, and comfort.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Direct.</hi> Make ſerious uſe of marks and ſigns. The beſt ſearch is in a man's own heart, and there, the greateſt caſe of conſcience is, whether Chriſt be in you, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. One of the beſt uſes the preacher can make, is a uſe of tryal. Skilful ones lay open theſe marks with much evidence and vehemence; beſeech, require, charge that impartial ſearch be made: And Chriſtians hear and affect, and ſay it is a home-Sermon; but do not ſeriouſly upon retirement bring themſelves to the truth. The Miniſter may preach his lungs out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and it is not minded. If ſelf-tryal were impartially practiſed, the bleſſed ſpirit in this way would give in evidence, and by that comfort: for inſtance, Jeſus Chriſt tells us, he lays down his life for his ſheep, <hi>John</hi> 10. there he gives the marks of his ſheep: as firſt, They do not follow the voice of ſtrangers. <hi>i. e.</hi> Strange doctrines, duties, worſhip; as Socinianiſm, Popery, Pelagia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm new or old, Quakeriſm; they fly from them: they know not the voice of ſtrangers, <hi>v.</hi> 5. 2. They know Chriſt with an high appreciating and obedient knowledg, <hi>v.</hi> 14. 3. They hear his voice, and they follow him; not a ſtranger. <hi>v.</hi> 28. Now if you would try your ſelves by theſe and many, very many ſuch like, if you would impartially ſee the complexion of your ſouls in the glaſs of the word, this would beget certainty, and that would beget com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Direct.</hi> Be not ſlothful in the buſineſs of Faith, remove away far from you a ſluggiſh frame, ſtir up, blow up the coals, exerciſe thy Faith, exert new acts of application of Jeſus Chriſt to thee daily. We want comfort, and why? Jeſus Chriſt is not in our ſerious thoughts all the day. We eat bread daily for life natural, and cloath our ſelves daily to cover our nakedneſs before men: ſure the ſoul hath as much need of food and rayment as the body: Jeſus cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified is the onely, the Heavenly food and rayment; ſtir up thine appetite, <hi>Mitte ſidem,</hi> put forth thine hand, put him on; repeated acts of recumbency and application will riſe up into acquaintance and evidence, and will let in this precious joy and conſolation. Believe it, Sirs, it is a ſin of a far greater nature than we are aware of, a ſin of horrid unkindneſs, neglect, ſlighting
<pb n="628" facs="tcp:95740:325"/> of our beſt friends, <hi>(viz.)</hi> that we make ſure of every thing, but Jeſus Chriſt. A little land, a ſmall <hi>Tenement,</hi> a little money, there we cry faſt bind, and faſt find; there we have a male in the flock, and can defend our dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence very ſmartly: but in the great concern of our ſouls we are at uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and hap hazard; there the blind and the lame is for ſacrifice. What a noiſe is there about a civil propriety in mint and cummin? and what a Silence and remiſneſs about the ſoul's propriety in the Son of God? 'tis a prodigious and inexcuſable indiſcretion and folly; and an unſpeakable miſchief into the bargain.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Direct.</hi> Take heed of thy heart, fetch not thy comforts from, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate not thy joy upon any creature; this were clear idolatry: therefore check thy joy about theſe things, cut off the ſuckers, and the boughs will be laden with fruit, ſtop theſe back-ditches and the ſtream will be ſtrong. Remember <hi>Job</hi> could approve his ſincerity by this, that he did not rejoyce becauſe his wealth was great, and becauſe his hand had gotten much. <hi>Cap.</hi> 31. <hi>v.</hi> 24. Remember our Lord Chriſt abated his diſciples joy, <hi>Rejoyce not in this that the Devils are ſubject to you;</hi> (a man may caſt out Devils and go to hell.) <hi>but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce rather in this, that your names are in the book of life.</hi> Act Faith to ſee God the giver, Chriſt the purchaſer of your daily mercies, and thence fetch your joy into them: My cloaths firſt muſt have warmth from my body, and then they warm me.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Direct.</hi> If a Chriſtian would attain to that Faith (<hi>viz.</hi> certainty) that will make his life comfortable, he muſt go on to be more holy in both the parts of it: he muſt die to ſin more. The Scripture calls upon us every where to hate, abhor, mortifie, crucifie <hi>(viz.)</hi> to death, lay aſide as a dead corps, put off as filthy rags, caſt away as a plague-ſore, what all this while? why, luſts, filthy luſts, wrath, anger, vain-glory, pride, impatience, filthy wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton thoughts. You know the Apoſtle preſſeth theſe things as the main uſe of the Doctrine of Jeſus: <hi>Paul</hi> is abundant in this in his Epiſtles to the Churches; do it then, dwell upon theſe Scriptures much, daily let them dwell in you, be docrs of the word. Your miniſters are afraid, either of the rickets, the head is big with airy notions, or but notions, and the joynts be weak; or Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhneſs, that people are more taken with a little gawdy trimming than with the ſubſtance of the cloth. Study theſe truths, and look to your hearts, and conform to them, this is the way for to get, and when you have got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to keep ſome aſſurance, and that will comfort your hearts; the pure in heart ſhall ſee God, and any glimpſe of that is a moſt comfortable ſight. The Scripture ſaith, eſpecially in Goſpel times, that the people of God ſhould walk in the light of his countenance: if thou put away iniquity from thy heart, thou ſhalt lift up thy face; the more conſcience, the more ſenſe of love, and the more ſenſe the more comfort; the leſs clouds the more fun. The old Puritans had a great deal of feeling, and much Serious joy.</p>

            <p n="7">7. <hi>Direct.</hi> All this while I take it for granted that thou art a Chriſtian. Why then, if thou wilt get and keep this Faith that will get and keep comfort alive, The ſeventh direction is, To be much and frequent in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine meditation; Faith is enlarged and grows up by converſe with divine objects: meditate upon theſe things, 1. Chriſt's Deity. Be well ſtored with Scriptural knowledg of this great truth, ſet thy heart to it, and let it be fixed in the midſt of thy heart, aſſure your ſelves that the eternal Godhead of Jeſus is the moſt practical point in Heaven, and will be ſo while Heaven is Heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Be intimately acquainted with Chriſt's righteouſneſs; that it is the only righteouſneſs that can preſent us <hi>holy, unreprovable, unblameable,</hi> in God's ſight; that it was his buſineſs in the world to bring in this <hi>everlaſting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs;</hi> that it is done and finiſhed; that he hath nothing to do with this righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs now in Heaven, but to cloath us with, to preſent us in, before God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Meditate on God's righteouſneſs, that it is not only his will, but his nature to puniſh ſin; ſin muſt damn thee without Chriſt, there is not only a poſſibility or probability that ſin may ruine, but without an intereſt in Chriſt it muſt do ſo; whet much upon thy heart that <hi>muſt,</hi> God can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but hate ſin, becauſe he is holy; and he cannot but puniſh ſin, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is righteous. God muſt not forego his own nature to gratifie our humors.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Direct.</hi> Be well skilled and ſettled (as it becomes a Chriſtian) in the great article of juſtification before God: thy Faith, and duties, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts depend might and main upon this. Know that no ſervant of God, be he <hi>Abraham, Moſes,</hi> or <hi>Paul,</hi> if God enter into judgment with him, can ſtand juſtified in his ſight, God will not juſtifie us without a righteouſneſs, and that righteouſneſs muſt be unblamable; and therefore in all numbers perfect: God will not call that perfect which is not ſo, for his judgment is according to truth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.2. where ſhall we find this perfect righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but in Chriſt, who is <hi>Jehovah our righteouſneſs, Jer.</hi> 23.6. and <hi>made of God to us righteouſneſs?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. how ſhall this become ours, but by imputation? <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.6. how ſhall we receive this gift of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, but by Faith? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17. be well skilled in the good old way, go in the foot ſteps of the flock, and feed beſides the ſhepherds tents.

            <p>Be wiſe and wary; there are many adverſaries. Only give me leave to ſay this, I think that the Socinians had never ſet up man's obedience for his righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, if they had not with wicked hands, <hi>quantum in illis,</hi> firſt pulled down Chiſt's Deity: and as they are abhorred for this blaſphemy of blaſphemies, ſo I cannot abide them for dawbing over man's obedience in this affair ſo deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and deceivingly, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in ſaying it is not only <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non</hi> in our juſtification, as if the material cauſe or the matter which God imputes for righteouſneſs, were only a poor <hi>cauſa ſine quâ non;</hi> but no more now of this jugling.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Direct.</hi> If you would preſerve a right underſtanding of the nature of Faith take heed of advancing it into Chriſt's place, as if God ſhould impute the act of Faith for righteouſneſs, or that God ſhould impute Faith and obedience as the condition or matter of our righteouſneſs and not Chriſt's obedience; for both cannot be imputed: if God imputed Chriſt's obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, then not ours; if ours, then not Chriſt's. The nature of Faith conſiſts in coming to Chriſt for righteouſneſs and pardon: only; the man hurt with the fiery ſting, looks to the brazen Serpent for cure. <hi>Fides que,</hi> that Faith which is juſtifying takes in Chriſt as Lord, with all the heart; but <hi>qua juſtificat,</hi> in the buſineſs of juſtifitation <hi>qua ſic,</hi> it looks only to Chriſt as crucified: This plain old diſtinction will ſtand. If the nature of Faith did conſiſt in Chriſtianity, I ſay, if this were true, I believe all believers could be contented to have it ſo, for any harm they ſhould have by it, for they willingly devote themſelves to the obedience of God; only they cannot make this Faith, or Chriſtianity to be the condition or matter of juſtification, for this were to fall from grace, to make of none effect the death of Chriſt; and to drive Chriſtianity and comfort out of the world.</p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Direct.</hi> Get and keep this Faith, ſpecially by a conſtant and conſcio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable living in duty, and living above it. Say to the commandements you are my rule, and love, and joy; to Chriſt thou art my life, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.4. 'Tis the height of Chriſtianity to live in duties, and to live above them. 'Tis quickly ſaid, 'tis an eaſie matter to diſtinguiſh in the Schools or pulpit, but to diſtinguiſh in the conſcience, practically to diſtinguiſh, is not ſo eaſie: <hi>qui novit diſtinguere inter legem &amp; evangelium, ſciat ſe eſſe edoctum à Deo.</hi> Had I all the holineſs of the Saints from the beginning to this day, I would bleſs God for the leaſt, and prize it above all treaſures; yet I would lay all aſide and be found in Chriſt. In the midſt of thy duties ask thy ſoul the queſtion, ſoul, what is thy title, thy plea? If I were to dye this day, what have I to plead? in what ſhall I ſtand before God? what have I to plead, why I ſhould not periſh in hell? ask thy ſelf, what is thy righteouſneſs? ask it ſolemnly, frequently; is it not Chriſt and he only? this would much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to confirm thy Faith, ſuch a Faith that would bring in comfort.

This and meditation who can hinder? The ſoul is active, breathings and thoughts are quick, it is ſoon done, it will never hinder your buſineſs, and in this way the bleſſed ſpirit cauſeth us to know and believe the love that God hath to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. and refreſheth the ſoul with joy and comfort in believing. Do not only pray for the comforts and ſupplies of the holy ſpirit, but pray to him to this purpoſe: Bleſſed ſpirit convince me of my ſins more, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince me more and more of Jeſus Chriſt; Holy Spirit take of Chriſt's and ſhew it unto me, and the like. To paſs by the prophane ſcoffs of many, and the groſs ignorance of more, I take it to be a very great neglect in believers, that they do not glorifie the Holy Spirit, as the Lord and giver of Faith and comfort. Remember this, <hi>qui unum honorat, &amp; omnes,</hi> he that honoureth one perſon aright, honoureth every one; and he that doth not honour every perſon honoureth none, <hi>qui non omnes, nec u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam.</hi>

            <p>It may be <hi>objected,</hi> how can this be? can any creature be <hi>ſelf-ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent?</hi> is not that a thing peculiar to God himſelf? are not all here in themſelves indigent and neceſſitous? <hi>I anſwer, Original</hi> and <hi>inherent</hi> ſelf-ſufficiency belongs only to God; but there is a <hi>dependent, derived,</hi> and <hi>borrowed</hi> ſelf-ſufficiency, and that every gracious perſon hath. He ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God for his God, and he poſſeſſing this God (the Catholick and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Good,) in and from him, he hath all that ever he can deſire or need: and ſo in a <hi>borrowed ſenſe</hi> he is ſelf-ſufficient. <hi>Jacob</hi> told his Brother <hi>he had all</hi> (for ſo 'tis in the <hi>Hebr.)

            <p>Now let us bring the Queſtion to Contentment in this notion, <hi>How
<pb n="637" facs="tcp:95740:329"/> may men come up to this ſelf-ſufficiency?</hi> Anſw. By their getting a <hi>Covenant-intereſt</hi> in God, and then by their <hi>improving</hi> and living upon that God, who is theirs by Covenant. Till this be done, there is no <hi>ſelf-fulneſs,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but want and emptineſs; and conſequently no contentment, or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction. Whatever good is in the creature, it is a <hi>finite, ſcanty, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fective</hi> good; and therefore that can never fill up all the deſires, or anſwer all the wants of a ſoul. We ſee even where there is much of that good, yet the heart is reſtleſs and unſatisfied, <hi>Job</hi> 20.22. <hi>In the fulneſs of his ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency, he ſhall be in ſtraits:</hi> But God is a <hi>perfect, compleat, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive</hi> good; all goodneſs whatſoever concenters and concurrs in him, and thereupon, when a man is once brought to have and to poſſeſs God, he is ſatisfied, all his deſires are anſwered; in the having of God he hath all, and this muſt needs content him. This explication of <hi>Contentment</hi> is not ſo much taken notice of; but it points to that which is the higheſt and moſt excellent part of it. Oh, to be <hi>ſelf-ſufficient,</hi> for the poor Creature to have all in himſelf, (he having that God who is All,) how near doth this bring him to that which is the incommunicable glory and perfection of God himſelf! As ever you deſire to be partakers of this, follow the <hi>Direction</hi> here given you.

                  </p>
               </note> Soul being made by God, and for God, nothing can fill it but God. Let a man injoy never ſo much of the world, yet if there be but ſome petty thing (which his fancy is much ſet upon) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held from him, this is the bane of his contentment; (as we ſee in <hi>Ahab</hi> and <hi>Haman:</hi>) On the other hand, let a Child of God enjoy never ſo little of the world, yet he having and knowing God to be his God, and he by faith living upon this God, his ſoul is at reſt, he hath full contentment and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Contentment</hi> lies in the <hi>bounding and moderating of the deſires after earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſſions;</hi> ſo that the heart is not ſtill craving and deſiring more and more, but well contented with the preſent proportion allotted by God.

O, (ſaith the Contented perſon,) the Lord hath very well provided for me, I have enough for me and mine; God gives me <hi>food</hi> and <hi>raiment,</hi> 'tis enough; I have as much as I need, a great deal more than what I deſerve, and had I more, it would be but burdenſome; 'tis very well, God hath made a good choice for me; Others may have more, I have that which is ſufficient: here's <hi>Contentment.</hi>

            <p>Let's bring the Queſtion to it, as thus ſtated; <hi>How may perſons learn to be content with what they have, ſo as not to be covetouſly greedy of having more?</hi> I anſwer, this muſt be attained</p>

               </note>3.

Unqueſtionably this was one <hi>thing</hi> (if not the main) intended by our Apoſtle, when he ſaith, <hi>I have learned in every ſtate to be content:</hi> 'Tis as if he had ſaid, I am brought to this, alwaies to think well of God, and of every ſtate into which he is pleaſed to bring me; whatever pleaſes him, pleaſeth me, be it impriſonment, poverty, ſickneſs, reproach, death it ſelf, let but God's will be done and I am content; I am taught to bear all things with great<note n="*" place="margin">A.

            <p>The Queſtion then will come to this; <hi>How may we, and Others, get this excellent frame, to have the heart in every ſtate calm and quiet, without being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbed and diſcontented under any thing that doth befall us?</hi> (the reſolving of this Queſtion will be my preſent work.)</p>

            <p>Now (as to theſe <hi>three Directions</hi>) it is with me, as it ſometimes is at the head of a ſpring; where the ſtream at firſt is ſo narrow, that with eaſe any may ſtride over it, but afterwards it doth very much widen and dilate it ſelf, in ſo much that the little ſtream is turned into a vaſt river. So here, take theſe <hi>three Heads</hi> in the General, and at the firſt naming of them, ſo my work ſeems to lie in a very ſmall compaſs; but when I come to make a further, and more diſtinct inquiry into them, truly there is a vaſt ſea before me, where 'tis hard to find any bounds or limits. I ſhall go over them with as much brevity as the Subject will admit of, and as may beſt conduce to the great end, (the furtherance of Contentment.)</p>
            <p>The firſt means is <hi>Conſideration.</hi> By which I underſtand,<note place="margin">Of the past help, <hi>viz.</hi> Conſideration.</note> not only that which is <hi>rational</hi> and proper to a <hi>Man,</hi> (as a Man,) but that which is <hi>religious</hi> and <hi>divine;</hi> both together, but eſpecially the latter, have a great influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contentment.

               <hi>'Tis a great ſoul which ſurrenders up it ſelf to God; but that's a poor low ſoul which contends, and thinks ill of the ordering of the world, and which would rather mend the Gods than it ſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here in our <hi>conſidering</hi> (in order to the having of the heart ſmooth and calm,) 'tis good to take in more; <hi>viz.</hi> not only to employ our thoughts upon the <hi>thing,</hi> but alſo upon the <hi>modification,</hi> and <hi>circumſtances</hi> thereof; not only to think of this that <hi>all is ordered</hi> by God, but <hi>how</hi> and in what <hi>manner</hi> all is ordered by him.

            <p>Now take an account of this in four things.</p>

<pb n="641" facs="tcp:95740:331"/> that 'tis a vain thing for any to go about to reſiſt and hinder God in what he will do. If Man will be croſs, and thwart and controll him, what doth it ſignifie? God's vvill ſhall be done for all that: He will <hi>do all his pleaſure:</hi> there is no contending with him. <hi>Job</hi> 34.33. <hi>Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompenſe it, whether thou refuſe or whether thou chooſe,</hi> &amp;c. Chriſtian! Thou paſſionately deſireſt ſuch a mercy; thou ſhalt have it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the ſooner for that: If God will beſtow it, thou ſhalt have it; If he will withhold it, all thy earneſtneſs and ſtriving will do no good. Or thou wouldſt fain have ſuch an affliction removed; that will not do thy work: If God will take it off from thee, there's an end of it; If he will continue it, thou muſt bear it ſtill. Humble <hi>Contentment</hi> may do much; but proud <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending</hi> will do nothing. God knows what he hath to do, and he will not be hindred in what he ſees fit to do. Pray therefore, whenever paſſion begins to riſe in the ſoul, think of this ſpeedily: If it be thus, that the tide of Providence vvill have its courſe, that there's no hindring of the Almighty and Soveraign-acting God, <hi>(for he doth whatſoever pleaſeth him,</hi> Eccl. 8.3. <hi>and worketh all things after the counſel of his own will, Eph.</hi> 1.11.) then our Reaſon and judgment will tell us, that 'tis beſt to yield and ſubmit to this God, and to comply with that which we cannot al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

               <hi>the Lord is righteous in all his wayes and holy in all his works: Juſt and true are all thy wayes, O thou King of Saints.

We have often too juſt Grounds of being troubled with our own hearts, (becauſe of their pride, carnality, unthankfulneſs, unbelief, &amp;c. this is good diſcontent;) but we never have any juſt Grounds of being diſturbed at what God doth; he being in all his actings holy and righteous.

            </p>
            <p n="3">3. All is ordered by God <hi>wiſely;</hi> He's a <hi>God of Judgment, Iſai.</hi> 30.18. We read of the rings, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.18. that they were <hi>full of eyes;</hi> take the ſeveral <hi>rounds,</hi> and <hi>windings</hi> of Providence, they are all full of wiſdom. As God at the firſt <hi>made</hi> all things with infinite wiſdom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.24. ſo he doth alſo <hi>diſpoſe</hi> and <hi>govern</hi> all things with infinite wiſdom. And this holds true, not only with reſpect to the <hi>whole Creation,</hi> in the general lump and maſs thereof; but alſo with reſpect to <hi>every part</hi> and <hi>parcel</hi> of the Creation: eſpecially to man, and to every <hi>individual man</hi> in the world. Now if this was believed and conſidered, it could not but much conduce to make us contented in every condition; for certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly it muſt be moſt abſurd folly in us to find fault with, or diſlike that which is done by God in admirable wiſdom. In our worldly affairs, vvherein vve have to do wtth men, if vve apprehend them to be perſons endued with underſtanding and prudence, we can upon this wholly refer our ſelves and our Concerns to them, and quietly acquieſce in vvhat they adviſe and order. The Patient likes the Phyſick (though never ſo nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeous) which his skilful Phyſitian preſcribes: If the <hi>Pilot</hi> be skilful, the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenger ſaith, Let him alone, he knows how to order the veſſel; (and ſo in ſeveral other Inſtances:) And why do not vve in all our Concerns carry it thus towards God, vvhoſe vviſdom and faithfulneſs doth infinitely tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend vvhat is in man? ſhall we not contentedly reſt in vvhat he ſees to be fitteſt and beſt for us? <hi>Vain man would be wiſe, Job</hi> 11.12. he thinks he could order things better than God doth; he vvill be finding faults in God's diſpoſal of him; but this his vviſdom is the higheſt folly. What a wiſe Choice doth God alwayes make for men? the Saints ſhall ſee it vvhen they come to Heaven, if not before; may they not therefore quietly reſign up themſelves to him, ſaying <hi>Thou ſhalt chooſe our inheritance for us,</hi> (as 'tis, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 47.4.)? On the other hand; vvhat a ſad choice do men make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when in their diſcontent they vvill be their own chooſers? <hi>Rachel</hi> muſt have a Child, or ſhe dies; ſhe had her deſire, but it coſt her her life. <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob</hi> cannot ſtay God's time for the bleſſing; by vvhich haſtineſs, in what a world of troubles did he involve himſelf?

Oh what a bleſſed ſecurity of mind ſhould we have in every ſtate, did we but live in the ſteady belief, and ferious conſidrration of God's unſearchable wiſdom!</p>
            <p n="4">4. All is ordered by God <hi>graciouſly.</hi> Pſal. 25.10, <hi>All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth unto ſuch as keep his covenant, and his teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</hi> Is it Poverty, Pain, Sickneſs, loſs of Relations, worldly croſſes? all is <hi>in mercy,</hi> or in order <hi>to mercy</hi> to God's Covenant-people. I do not ſay, that all <hi>is mercy</hi> to theſe <hi>formally</hi> (as to the things themſelves which befall them,) but I ſay all is <hi>mercy,</hi> or in order <hi>to mercy.</hi> Afflictions are not mercy in their <hi>formal nature,</hi> but they are <hi>of</hi> mercy <hi>originally</hi> (they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from God's love,) and <hi>for</hi> mercy <hi>finally,</hi> (God by them deſigning good, and nothing but good to them that love him.) This is a thing in ſpecial to be thought of by thoſe who belong to God; Others have the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> of God to awe them, but <hi>Saints</hi> have the <hi>mercy</hi> and <hi>goodneſs</hi> of God to work their hearts to a quiet ſubmiſſion to his Will. And how much is there in this for the furtherance of ſuch a frame of heart in them, could they but by conſideration draw it out and work it home upon the ſoul! What? a Child of God to vex and fret at this, or that? when all is intended for his good, and ſhall be for good to him? (according to that great Promiſe <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28.)</p>
            <p>God alwayes knows what is beſt for his (ſuch is his wiſdom,) and he alwayes doth what is beſt for his (ſuch is his <hi>mercy:</hi>) what a heart compoſing me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation is this! There's much in the other Attributes before mentioned to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs inward perturbations; but there's more in that which I am now upon. Is mercy and goodneſs the ingredient in every condition? then be it never ſo bitter, the ſenſe of this muſt needs ſweeten it. Is all ordered by a Father? in love? not to hurt men, but to do them good? Oh, why then ſhould I give way to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content? The truth is, it is too low for the Saints in every ſtate barely to be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent;</hi> there's ſomething higher that they ſhould come up unto, namely to <hi>rejoyce evermore in the Lord,</hi> and in <hi>every thing to be giving thanks.</hi>

               <note place="margin">Conſideration about the ſtate it ſelf.</note> for out of that much may be fetched to further Contentment. <hi>Paul</hi> (our great Inſtance in the Text) weighed and conſidered every ſtate into which he was brought, and by that means he <hi>learnt in every ſtate to be content.</hi> Let us take the ſame courſe, and (through the bleſſing of God) we ſhall find the ſame effect.</p>

               <hi>How is a Chriſtian to manage Conſideration with reſpect to his ſtate?</hi> I anſwer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Let him conſider that his <hi>ſtate</hi> is <hi>mixt.</hi> Its neither <hi>purely good,</hi>
               <note place="margin">'Tis mixt.</note> nor <hi>purely evil,</hi> but there's a mixture of the one with the other;
'tis ſweet and
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:95740:333"/> bitter mingled together: 'Tis not <hi>all mercy</hi> (that's reſerved for Heaven;) nor <hi>all miſery</hi> (that's reſerved for Hell;) but ſomething of <hi>both</hi> (that's pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to the middle ſtate of earth) <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7.14, <hi>God hath ſet the one over againſt the other</hi> (Proſperity and Adverſity, Comforts and Croſſes, Mercies and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,) <hi>to the end that man ſhould find nothing after him</hi> (ſo as to find fault with what God doth, or to ſay this and that might have been better ordered by him.) Now if men would but let their thoughts dwell upon this, how would it tend to the quieting of their minds in every Condition! <hi>For ſhall we receive good at the hands of God and ſhall we not receive evil?</hi> Job 2.10. Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when we conſider, (1.) That <hi>the good is much more than the evil;</hi> and (2.)

The truth is, contentment is better than any comfort which we

'Tis a ſad <hi>inlet to Sin:</hi> what will not a man do, when he is under the power of diſcontent? he'l ſhift for himſelf, uſe unlawful means, do any thing to better his condition; if nothing will do this for him, he can even lay violent hands upon himſelf; (Oh that we had not too many ſad examples of this)! 'Tis a ſad <hi>preparation to all temptations:</hi> the Devil will be ſure to be fiſhing where the waters are troubled; as Flies ſettle upon the galled back, ſo the Tempter betakes himſelf to the man that is in pain with his condition. It <hi>deprives of Happineſs;</hi> for the diſcontented perſon alwayes thinks himſelf miſerable, and ſo he can never be happy: <hi>Nemo felix eſt, qui ſuo judicio miſer eſt; (Salvian. de Provid.)</hi> It <hi>expoſes to dreadful judgments:</hi> What ſevere puniſhments did the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> murmuring bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them?

            <p>Now if theſe things were but laid to heart, and ſeriouſly conſidered by Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, would not the conſideration thereof much conduce to their attaining and living of Contentment? Certainly the due fixing and working of the thoughts upon the <hi>excellency</hi> of <hi>this frame,</hi> of the <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>evil</hi> of the <hi>contrary
<pb n="647" facs="tcp:95740:334"/> frame,</hi> vvould be of great uſe, and very effectual towards the compoſing and quieting of their ſpirits, in every condition. Suppoſe it pleaſeth the Lord ſo or ſo to afflict me, to exerciſe me with ſuch or ſuch things, which are very croſs to my deſires, and hereupon I find my heart to begin to be moved; vvhat's now to be done to prevent the further growth of Paſſion? why I'le retire, and vveigh with my ſelf what a gracious temper of Soul contentment is, vvhat a ſinful and curſed temper of Soul diſcontent is; how much I ſhall pleaſe God and profit my ſelf by the one, how much I ſhall offend God and prejudice my ſelf by the other: this my thoughts ſhall ſtay upon, and I'le rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with my ſelf, <hi>Why art thou, O my Soul, thus diſquieted within me?</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 42.11.</note> This is the Courſe which I reſolve to take in my afflicted condition to keep my heart ſtill and compoſed, hoping that God will bleſs it to the end. Ay and ſo do, for 'tis a good one; and many by experience have found the benefit of it.</p>

               </gap> than that one thing, vvhich I am upon. Whence is it that there is amongſt Men, amongſt Profeſſors, ſo little of Contentment? that ſo few have learnt in every ſtate to be content? that impatience, repining, quarelling with God, diſcontent, are ſo epidemical? that the moſt live in the diſlike of their condition? I ſay, whence is this? I anſwer, 'tis (in a great meaſure) from the general neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Conſideration. Could vve but bring men to this, Contentation vvould not be ſo rare a thing as now it is. I do not aſſert this <hi>one Means</hi> to be ſufficient, but (believe me) it would go very far. Well, as any of you deſire for the time to come to be, as here <hi>Paul</hi> was, vvhenever any thing troubles you, ſee that you fall upon conſideration; and draw it to theſe three Heads, <hi>Who orders your ſtate, How your ſtate is circumſtantiated, What the frame it ſelf</hi> is.</p>
            <p>So much for the <hi>firſt</hi> thing in the <hi>Direction,</hi> the <hi>ſpecial Matter upon which Conſideration is to be acted in order to Contentment.</hi> I go on to the <hi>ſecond,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Particular ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes wherein Conſideration is to be acted in order to Contentment.</note> viz. <hi>to inſtance in ſome of thoſe ſpecial Caſes unto which contentment doth mainly refer;</hi> and to ſhew, <hi>how Conſideration is to be managed to help on the practice of the Duty in each of them.</hi> I have (in vvhat hath gone before) ſeldom made any particular mention of theſe Inſtances, becauſe I deſigned to ſpeak parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly and apart to them under this Head. To ſpeak to <hi>all</hi> (and that too according to the copiouſneſs of the ſubject) vvould be a vaſt work; I ſhall only ſingle out ſome <hi>few</hi> of the moſt <hi>uſual Caſes,</hi> and be alſo but very brief upon them.</p>
            <p>Heart-inquietude or Diſcontent doth too often ariſe from what is in and about the inner man, and is of a ſpiritual nature; as <hi>lowneſs of gifts, weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of grace, the continuance and ſtrength of ſin, temptations by Satan, God's withdrawings, want of Aſſurance and of the Comforts of the Spirit,</hi> (and the like.) But moſt commonly it ariſeth from things of a <hi>worldly nature,</hi> wherein the <hi>outward part</hi> is concerned, (for that is our tendereſt part, and therefore, if we be troubled there, we are moſt apt to complain:) ſuch as <hi>lowneſs of Eſtate, croſſes in Relations, bodily Infirmities, badneſs of the Times, injuries
<pb n="648" facs="tcp:95740:335"/> and bad uſages of Men, meanneſs of rank and Quality in the world,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe are the things which uſually diſturb and diſquiet us: But now for each of them, there is that <hi>Conſideration</hi> which is proper for the ſettling and compoſing of our minds: I muſt ſpeak only to the two firſt,</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Lowneſs of Eſtate.</note>As to <hi>lowneſs of Eſtate,</hi> how is the world filled with Diſcontent about that? Poverty is an affliction which few do with patience undergo: When the <hi>belly pines,</hi> the <hi>backſtarves,</hi> 'tis hard to keep the heart in a <hi>ſubmiſſive frame.</hi> 'Tis an eaſie matter, for them that are <hi>full</hi> to adviſe them that are <hi>in want</hi> to be content; but if they themſelves were in wants, they would not find it ſo eaſie a matter to follow their own advice.

            <p>Now <hi>Conſideration,</hi> wiſely and faithfully managed, would be of great uſe to allay all ſtorms and to keep the heart even and calm in all <hi>theſe Caſes:</hi> and therefore my next work is to ſhew, <hi>what we are, under each of them, to conſider in order to the promoting of this frame.</hi> But I muſt of neceſſity be briefer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der <hi>this Head</hi> than I was under the <hi>former,</hi> that I may not draw out this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to too great a length. Wherefore I will but ſhortly ſet the <hi>Particulars</hi> before you that you are to conſider of, and leave the enlargement of them to your ſelves in your conſideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>When Relations are much deſired, but denied and withheld, there is too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten diſcontent.</hi>
               <note place="margin">How as to the want of Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions deſired.</note> As to inſtance only in <hi>Children:</hi> what daily inquietudes of ſpirit are there in ſome becauſe of the want of theſe! they have many other Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts, but the not having of this imbitters all. <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was much troubled about it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2, 3. <hi>Lord God, what wilt thou give me ſeeing I go child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs? Behold to me thou haſt given no ſeed, and lo one born in my houſe is mine heir.</hi> But <hi>Rachel's</hi> paſſion roſe very high, <hi>Give me Children</hi> (ſaith ſhe to her husband) <hi>or elſe I die,</hi> Gen. 30.2. Children are very <hi>great bleſſings;</hi> they are promiſed <hi>as ſuch,</hi> Pſal. 128.3, 4. (and in other places;) and indeed they are one of the ſweeteſt flowers that grow in the garden of earthly comforts; hence 'tis hard for perſons contentedly to bear the want of them. But whoever you are upon whom this affliction lies, pray labour after a <hi>contented mind</hi> under it; and in order thereunto Conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>It is the Lord who withholds this mercy;</hi> for he gives it or withholds it as ſeems good to him. Providence is not more ſeen in any of the affairs and Concerns of men, than in this of Children; that there ſhall be <hi>many</hi> or <hi>few, ſome</hi> or <hi>none,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Gen. 32.</note> all falls under the good pleaſure and diſpoſe of God. When <hi>Rachel</hi> was ſo paſſionate under the want of theſe, <hi>Jacob</hi> rebuked her ſharply, <hi>am I in God's ſtead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of thy womb?</hi> Pſal. 127.9. <hi>Lo chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are an inheritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is his reward,</hi> Pſal. 113.9. <hi>He maketh the barren woman to keep houſe, and to be a joyful Mother of children.</hi> Now if this was duly thought of, would it not quiet the heart? when the thing is ordered by God, ſhall we diſlike and fret at what he doth? may not he diſpenſe his bleſſings where he pleaſeth? Oh if he will give,
<pb n="657" facs="tcp:95740:339"/> we ſhould be thankful in the owning of his <hi>Goodneſs;</hi> if he will deny, we muſt be patient in the owning of his <hi>Soveraignty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Sometimes this mercy is denyed, but better are beſtowed.</hi> God doth not give <hi>Children</hi> but he gives <hi>himſelf;</hi> and is not he <hi>better than ten Sons</hi> (as <hi>Elkanah</hi> ſaid of <hi>himſelf;</hi> to <hi>Hannah,</hi> 1 Sam. 1.8.?) There is a <hi>better name, than that of Sons and Daughters</hi> (promiſed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 56.3.4.) they who have that <hi>better name</hi> have no reaſon to murmur becauſe they have not that which <hi>is worſe.</hi> They who have God for their Father in heaven may well be content to go childleſs here on earth. If God will not give me the leſſer, yet if he gives me the greater Good, have I cauſe to be angry? ſurely no more than he hath to be angry with me, to whom I deny a braſs farthing and give him a purſe of Gold.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Children ſometimes are withheld a long time, but they are given at laſt;</hi> (of which we have many Inſtances.) The caſe is never deſperate ſo long as we can ſubmit and wait; 'tis to be hoped God deſigns to give us that comfort under the want of which we can be contented.</p>
            <p n="4">4. If Children be given after froward and irregular deſires of them,
'tis to be queſtioned <hi>whether it be done in mercy,</hi> and 'tis to be feared this frame will very much <hi>ſpoil the mercy.</hi> What we <hi>get by diſcontent</hi> we ſeldom <hi>enjoy with comfort.</hi> How many Parents have experienced the truth of this? they were not quiet till they had Children, and leſs quiet after they had them; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo undutiful, ſtubborn, naught, that there was much more of vexation in the having than there was in the wanting of them.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Many wanting the comfort of this Relation, it pleaſeth God to fill up the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of their other Relations:</hi> The <hi>Husband</hi> or the <hi>Wife</hi> are the better becauſe there are <hi>no childrn;</hi> and ſo the Lord recompences what is denied in <hi>one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation</hi> by <hi>doubling</hi> the comfort of <hi>another Relation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Children are great comforts but they are but mixt comforts.</hi> The Roſe hath its ſweetneſs, but it hath its pricks too; and ſo 'tis with Children. Oh the cares, fears, diſtractions, that Parents are filled with about them! they are <hi>cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cares, uncertain comforts,</hi> (as we uſually expreſs it.) We eye the ſweet on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of this Relation (and that makes us fretful:) did we eye the bitter alſo we ſhould be more ſtill and calm.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Had we this mercy in the height of it fill'd up in all reſpects according to our deſires and expectations, 'tis a thouſand to one but our hearts would be too much ſet upon it.</hi> And that would be of fatal conſequence to us upon <hi>many accounts;</hi> and therefore God foreſeeing this, 'tis out of kindneſs and love that he with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds it from us.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being conſidered as to this affliction, methinks they ſhould very much diſpoſe the heart to contentation under it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly: <hi>when dear Relations are taken away by death then it's a time of Diſcontent.</hi> To loſe a tender <hi>Husband,</hi> an affectionate <hi>Wife,</hi> an hopeful <hi>Child,</hi>
               <note place="margin">How as to the loſs of Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</note> a faithful <hi>Friend,</hi> oh! this is a cutting tryal, a very ſmarting rod! under which 'tis no eaſie thing to keep the ſpirit ſedate, free from all paſſion and diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſures: Yet as hard as it is, <hi>Conſideration</hi> would much facilitate it; Conſider therefore,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>About the true ſtating of this affliction.</hi> 'Tis great <hi>to us</hi> becauſe of the
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:95740:340"/> 
               <hi>greatneſs</hi> of our <hi>affection;</hi> but otherwiſe as to <hi>the thing</hi> in it ſelf, is it more than the breaking of a pitcher? than the dying or withering of a flower? than the nipping of a bloſſom? and vvill any conſiderate perſon be much moved at ſuch things as theſe? The <hi>Heathen</hi> bore the death of his child very well upon this conſideration; vvhen news thereof was brought to him he was not diſturbed, for (ſaid he) <hi>I knew I begot my child mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal.</hi> We forget what theſe comforts <hi>are</hi> and then we fret at the <hi>loſs</hi> of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Think of the <hi>commonneſs of this affliction.</hi> You think never was <hi>any ſorrow like to yours,</hi> never did any loſe <hi>ſuch</hi> a Husband, or <hi>ſuch</hi> a Wife, or <hi>ſuch</hi> a Child as you have done; alas! this is but the fondneſs and exceſs of love. Many have loſt as dear Relations as you have loſt (let them be what they will;) you are not the firſt, nor will be the laſt, who are thus exerciſed. When a <hi>Mercy</hi> is <hi>common</hi> in our eye, we ſet it <hi>too low;</hi> when an <hi>Affliction</hi> is <hi>ſingular</hi> in our eye, we ſet it too high,</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>'Tis God himſelf who makes this rod:</hi> If a ſparrow doth not <hi>fall to the ground</hi> vvithout him,<note place="margin">Math. 10.29.</note> certainly a <hi>dear Relation</hi> doth not; ſhall we not be ſilent before him?

            <p n="4">4. <hi>Is all taken?</hi> if <hi>not,</hi> thou haſt no reaſon to complain. The child is taken, but 'tis but one of many; but the Husband is yet ſpared; thou muſt not be impatient for what is removed but thankful for vvhat is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued; as <hi>Themiſtocles</hi> when <hi>Amyntas</hi> took away ſome of his diſhes, bore it contentedly, ſaying, <hi>he might have taken all.</hi> And pray keep down all paſſion, for this may make you loſe vvhat you have, though it vvill not regain you vvhat you have loſt. Oh but (ſome will ſay) <hi>my only child is dead:</hi> Is it ſo? thy affliction is the greater, but thy contentation muſt be never the leſs. He that gave an <hi>only ſon</hi> to thee may take an <hi>only child</hi> from thee: <hi>Iſaac</hi> vvas an only ſon, and yet <hi>Abraham</hi> vvillingly offered, him up to God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>'Twas high time for God to make a breach upon you.</hi> 'Tis the vviſdom of God to his, he vvill not let them have long what they over love: had you <hi>loved leſs</hi> the child might have <hi>lived longer.</hi> When theſe comforts are too much in our hearts, they muſt not be long in our hands. It's infinite mercy that God will ſecure our love to himſelf, and take that away from us which would take off our affections from him.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>'Tis that temper of ſoul which Chriſtianity calls for, quietly and readily to reſign up all our comforts to God's diſpoſe.</hi> Chriſtian, 'tis a great part of thy religion to be content under theſe croſſes; not to have thy comforts<note n="‖" place="margin">Omnia iſta nobis acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant non hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reant, ut ſi ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducantur, fine ullâ noſtri la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cetatione diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedant <hi>Senec.</hi> Ep. 74.</note> 
               <hi>torn</hi> from thee (as the plaiſter is from the fleſh) but to <hi>come off eaſily</hi> (as the glove doth from the hand.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Where there is ground of hope that the everlaſting ſtate of dead Relations is ſecured</hi> (as there is for the <hi>Adult</hi> who lived in the fear of God, for <hi>Children</hi>
               <pb n="659" facs="tcp:95740:340"/> deſcending from Parents in covenant with God) <hi>there 'tis mere ſelf-love which muſt cauſe diſcontent.</hi> For had we true love to the dead we ſhould rejoyce in their advancement, as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.28. <hi>if ye loved me, ye would rejoyce, becauſe I go to my Father.</hi> You are troubled becauſe they are not <hi>with you,</hi> but you ſhould joy in this that they are <hi>with Chriſt</hi> (which is <hi>far bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Phil. i. 21.</note>)</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Think how others have undergone this tryal. Aaron</hi> had his ſons cut off by a dreadful Judgment; but 'tis ſaid of him, <hi>he held his peace:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Levit. 10.3. Job 1.21. 2 Sam. 12.15. &amp;c. See <hi>Val. Max.</hi> l. 5. c. 10.</note> So it was with <hi>Job,</hi> and yet he <hi>bleſſed the Lord:</hi> So long as there was hope of the life of the child, <hi>David</hi> prayed and faſted; but when he ſaw God's will was done, he roſe up, and eat, and afflicted himſelf no more. Nay I might recite ſeveral examples of <hi>Heathens,</hi> who did (to the ſhame of us Chriſtians) bear the death of dear Relations with great equanimity and undiſturbedneſs of ſpirit. Well, I hint theſe ſeveral things to you, when any of you are thus tryed, I allow you a due and <hi>regular grief</hi> and ſenſe of God's afflicting hand; but there muſt be no <hi>vexing</hi> or <hi>diſcontent</hi> under it: which the Conſidering of the forementioned <hi>particulars</hi> may very much prevent or remove.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>Wben Relations continued prove uncomfortable;</hi>
               <note place="margin">How as to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable Relations?</note> this occaſions daily riſings of heart and much diſcontent. O the ſad fires of paſſion which hereby are kindled in many (too many) hearts and houſes! The comfort of Relations is grounded upon ſuitableneſs; where that is not, the roſe is turned into a briar or thorn: What is <hi>unſuitable</hi> is <hi>uncomfortable,</hi> (as the yoke that doth not ſuit or fit the neck is alwaies uneaſie.) Now this <hi>unſuitableneſs</hi> refers either to the <hi>natural temper</hi> or to ſomething of an <hi>higher nature,</hi> in both 'tis very afflictive; but eſpecially in the <hi>latter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There is an unſuitableneſs in reſpect <hi>of the natural temper or diſpoſition.</hi> I intend in this principally, Husband and Wife; the one is loving, mild, gentle, of an even and calm ſpirit, ſweet and obliging in his (or her) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe; the other is quite contrary, froward, paſſionate, cholerick, hard to be pleaſed, alwayes quarelling, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Here's a croſs now, and a heavy croſs too; but what's to be done by them that bear it, ſo as that they may <hi>learn Contentment</hi> under it? why, let them be often in <hi>conſidering</hi> theſe things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That God hath a ſpecial hand in this affliction:</hi> 'Tis he who brings per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons together in this relation; he made the <hi>match</hi> in Heaven before it was made on earth; and therefore he is to be eyed in all the Conſequences that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it: if it be <hi>comfort,</hi> he is to be <hi>bleſſed</hi> for it; if it be <hi>diſcomfort,</hi> he is to be ſubmitted to under it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Though this be a ſharp tryal, yet 'tis for good where it's ſanctified.</hi> It drives many nearer to God, weans them more from the world, keeps them humble, draws out their graces, gives them experience of ſupporting mercy, learns them to be more pitiful to others (and the like.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>May be this is the only affliction with which ſome are exerciſed.</hi> In all things elſe 'tis mercy, only in this thing God ſees it good to afflict: ſurely ſuch have little reaſon to be diſcontented. What? under ſuch <hi>variety</hi> of <hi>ſignal mercies</hi> canſt thou not bear contentedly <hi>one ſignal affliction?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="660" facs="tcp:95740:341"/>4. <hi>The Croſs is heavy, but patience and contentedneſs will make it lighter. Levius fit patientiâ quod corrigere eſt nefas:</hi> The more the Beaſt ſtrives the more the yoke pinches, the more quiet he is, the leſs it hurts him: and ſo it is in that Caſe which I am upon.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Poſſibly more ſuitable Relations were once enjoyed, but forfeited.</hi> So that if you will be angry it muſt be with <hi>your ſelves</hi> not <hi>with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Death will ſoon put an end to this Croſs;</hi> and we ſhall ſhortly be in that ſtate wherein we ſhall have nothing unſuitable to us.</p>
            <p>But (2.) There is an <hi>unſuitableneſs</hi> in <hi>higher</hi> things: ſuch as do more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concern the honour of God and the everlaſting condition of Souls; as <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>no Grace, Holineſs</hi> and <hi>ſin, Godlineſs</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs.</hi> Here now I principally intend Parents and Children, (though other Relations may be included alſo.) Here is a Parent that fears God, that lives an holy and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, that owns the good wayes of God, and walks in them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But his Child or Children are of a quite other Spirit, and take a quite other courſe: oh! they live in ſin and wickedneſs, in open enmity to God, carrying it as the Sons of <hi>Belial;</hi> they curſe, ſwear, drink, defile their bodies, profane Sabbaths, neglect duties, ſcoff at Godlineſs, puff at all good counſel, diſcover a Spirit obſtinately ſet againſt God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> This is an affliction of a very <hi>great ſtature,</hi> taller by the head and ſhoulders than ſeveral that have been ſpoken unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; yet many godly Parents groan under it, whoſe head and hearts are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by ungodly Children, (and never was this affliction more common than now when youth is ſo much debauched.) I verily believe, many good Parents could with much leſs grief bear the death of their Sons (were they but fit for it,) than that which they daily undergoe through the wickedneſs of their <hi>lives.</hi> Truly theſe are much to be pitied; yet I would deſire them to labour to be contented, and ſubmiſſively to bear this heavy croſs. In order to which frame let them conſider.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>That 'tis no new thing for good Parents to have bad Children,</hi> Sometimes it ſo happens that when the Father is bad the Son is good, but it more <hi>fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently</hi> happens (and God ſuffers it to be ſo, that the world may ſee Grace doth not run in a blood) that when the Father is good the Son is bad. It hath been ſo from the beginning; <hi>Adam</hi> had his <hi>Cain, Noah</hi> his <hi>Cham, Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> his <hi>Iſmael, Iſaac</hi> his <hi>Eſau, David</hi> his <hi>Amnon,</hi> (and ſo in many others:) and it will be ſo to the end of the world. Pray think of this, though 'tis a <hi>cutting</hi> yet but <hi>common</hi> affliction.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Children are ungodly, yet there is hope at laſt they may be reclaimed.</hi> As ſtubborn as they are, God can make them yield: he can change their hearts, and alter their courſe; and who knows <hi>at what day or hour he'l come?</hi> So long as there's Life there's hope of their Converſion. What a wicked Son was <hi>Manaſſe?</hi> yet God wrought upon him at laſt: What a ſad life did the <hi>Prodigal</hi> live? yet he returned to his Father at laſt.

Many of the old <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens</hi> ſeemed to go very far in contentment, to have a great maſtery o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver paſſion, in all occurrences to be very ſedate and calm: They notably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved their Reaſon and conſideration (if not wholly to <hi>ſuppreſs</hi> Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent yet however to <hi>keep it in,</hi> ſo as that Others ſhould not perceive it;) and many of them, through the <hi>firmneſs</hi> and <hi>greatneſs</hi> of their ſpirits, could and did bear much with great tranquillity of mind, (for <hi>the ſpirit of a man

But yet as to true <hi>Evangelical Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> they knew nothing of it; for that neceſſarily requires a <hi>divine principle within,</hi> and a <hi>divine</hi> and <hi>ſpecial aſſiſtance</hi> from above, to both of which they were altogether ſtrangers.

                  </gap>ineſs doth further Contentment.</note> it will be requiſite that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>How Godlineſs</hi> (or Grace) <hi>doth produce this effect of Contentation. Anſ.</hi> It doth it by theſe wayes or methods.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>As it rectifies and works in and upon the ſeveral Faculties of the Soul.</hi> For this is neceſſary to be done in order to Contentment; and it being done, Contentment cannot but follow upon it. Let me make this out parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly:</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Grace rectifies the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding:</hi> which it doth by diſpelling its natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral darkneſs, and ſetting up a clear and ſaving light in it. Now this <hi>light</hi> hath a great influence upon Contentment; for the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding</hi> being thus enlightned, <hi>Fancy</hi> and <hi>Imagination</hi> do not carry it in the ſoul as before they did; and hereupon the heart is brought to a more quiet temper. Our inquietudes of mind are founded in the power and prevalency of Fancy: We fancy ſuch and ſuch things to be <hi>evill,</hi> when in truth they are not ſo, (at leaſtwiſe as God ſanctifies them,) or to be <hi>more evil</hi> then in truth they are; and upon this, when thoſe things are laid upon us, we fret and vex: whereas do but take away this vanity and miſtake of fancy,<note place="margin">Nihil eſt mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerum niſi cum putes. <hi>Boeth.</hi> de Conſol. l. 3. Phil. 3.8.</note> there would be no ſuch great evil in what we ſuffer; <hi>Nihil admodum atrox paſſus es niſi id tu tibi fingis</hi> (as he of old truly ſaid.)</p>
            <p>And again, we fancy ſuch and ſuch things to be <hi>good,</hi> yea good in a very <hi>high degree;</hi> and then upon the want of them we are diſturbed: Whereas (if Fancy did not delude us) they have but very little good <hi>in themſelves,</hi> and as <hi>to us</hi> (in our ſpecial circumſtances) may be none at all: and therefore why ſhould we be troubled about them? The winds then ariſing from this point, Grace lays them by freeing the perſon from the power of <hi>fond ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination,</hi> and inſtead thereof by ſetting up <hi>ſolid judgment</hi> in him; ſo that he ſhall be able to judge aright of things, and not to perplex himſelf (one way or another) further than the nature of the thing before him will bear. Men generally are <hi>unquiet</hi> becauſe they are <hi>injudicious;</hi> if ſanctifying grace therefore, by that heavenly light which it brings into the Underſtanding, ſhall make them more judicious, by doing of this it muſt alſo make them more quiet. An <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned head</hi> promotes a <hi>ſubmiſſive heart;</hi> when 'tis <hi>right counting</hi> about worldly things then 'tis <hi>contentedneſs.</hi> No wonder that <hi>Paul had learned in every eſtate to be content,</hi> he having before learned <hi>to count all things but loſs for Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Grace rectifies the Will,</hi> thus; in cauſing it to <hi>comply</hi> with and <hi>yield</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="664" facs="tcp:95740:343" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Will of God. Whenever this ſupernatural habit is infuſed into a man there is a <hi>melting</hi> of his will into God's Will; ſo that there is but one and the ſame will between them. Now by this means it doth the work which I am ſpeaking of; for when 'tis thus, certainly there can be nothing but Contentment. What can put the ſpirit into diſorder when 'tis come to to this, <hi>Not as I will, but as thou wilt?</hi> When wind and tide go contrary wayes then the waters are rough and boiſterous, but when they both go the ſame way then all is calm and ſmooth: So here when God's will and Ours differ then ſtorms of paſſion riſe; but when they agree, there's nothing then but evenneſs and ſtilneſs in the ſpirit. Oh! we are never diſcontented but 'tis from the jarring and claſhing of our wills with God's:<note place="margin">Quod ſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, eſſe velis nihilque malis.</note> As he ſaid, <hi>Ceſſet voluntas propria, non erit infernum;</hi> ſo ſay I, Let but Chriſtians lay aſide their <hi>own will,</hi> and reſt in the <hi>will of God;</hi> and aſſuredly there will be no perturbation of mind in them. Indeed the duty of <hi>univerſal contentment</hi> is unpracticable till it come to this; and grace bringing the Creature to it, ſo it works Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Grace rectifies the Affections;</hi> in taking away their <hi>inordinacy</hi> towards earthly things, in keeping of them within their <hi>due bounds</hi> and limits; and ſo it works Contentment. What is it that cauſes unquietneſs in us? for the moſt part we may reſolve it into the <hi>unmortifiedneſs</hi> of ſome af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection or other. Luſt is the fuel that kindles and feeds this fire, that makes us to quarrel and fall out with God, becauſe our conditions are ſo and ſo. Great Veſſels muſt have much water or elſe they ſplit themſelves. Where the love is too great to earthly things, if much of them be not poſſeſt there's great danger of diſcontent, but where 'tis duly bounded, a little of theſe things ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth (as ſmaller veſſels ſail well enough even in ſhallow waters) The pain in the head proceeds from the foulneſs of the ſtomach; Purge but that, and the head hath eaſe: Purge but the heart from its unholy affections and a man hath eaſe and comfort in every condition. That which indangers impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, is the <hi>greatneſs of the Affliction?</hi> but what puts a greatneſs into the affliction? why, the <hi>greatneſs</hi> of the <hi>Affection:</hi> If the Relation was not overloved, the loſs of him would not amount to ſuch an affliction as 'tis uſually made: he that <hi>over-loves</hi> will <hi>over-grieve (Qui nimis amat nimis dolet,)</hi> and he that overgrieves will be apt to <hi>murmur.</hi> Grace then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining the Affections to theſe ſublunary things, ſo it furthers Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It makes <hi>the Conſcience good:</hi> And a good conſcience is that <hi>Ark</hi> into which God uſes to put the <hi>manna</hi> of concentment. It carries joy in it, 'tis a <hi>continual</hi> feaſt, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.15; now he that hath this <hi>joy within</hi> is not eaſily (or much) moved at any <hi>trouble without;</hi> let the weather be what it will there is nothing but ſerenity in his ſoul. If the part be ſore you cannot touch it but 'tis in pain; let it be but firm and ſound and it can bear a ſmart blow without complaining: when Conſcience is ſound and good a man can bear any thing; but when 'tis not ſo, he can bear nothing without being under great anguiſh of mind.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, Godlineſs works Contentment <hi>by making a perſon to have a powerful ſenſe of God's Glory, ſo as alwayes to reſt in that as his ultimate
<pb n="665" facs="tcp:95740:343"/> end and moſt deſirable good:</hi> (this is that glorious effect which Grace pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth in the heart.) And thereby it doth effectually further quietneſs of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in every condition. Pray obſerve it, <hi>Selfiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>lowneſs</hi> of mens <hi>ends</hi> is at the bottom of all their diſcontent: they look no higher than their <hi>ſenſual eaſe, delight</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction;</hi> and if they be croſſed in theſe then they ſtorm and are angry: But now a Godly man (living up to his Godlineſs) his eye is upon <hi>God's glory,</hi> as the thing which he chiefly aims at and mainly centers in, and upon this he is <hi>content in every ſtate.</hi> For (ſaith he) let my ſtate be what it will, God will glorifie himſelf by it; and 'tis that ſtate which God did ſee would moſt tend to his glory, (otherwiſe he had not put me into it,) oh! therefore I'le like it, yea rejoyce in it; in as much as it is moſt condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to that which is better than all my little comforts, namely the Glory of God. Methinks he ſhould live in all contentedneſs who knows and minds theſe <hi>two</hi> things, that <hi>all occurrences tend to the promoting of God's Honour,</hi> and then too <hi>of his Own Good:</hi> but the knowing and minding of theſe is proper only to one that is Godly; how neceſſary therefore is Godlineſs to contentment? Take an unregenerate man, theſe neither doe nor can ſignifie any thing to him: for as to <hi>the Firſt,</hi> the advancement of the Honour of his Creator, he being all <hi>for Self</hi> (for ſo every one is before converſion,) the honour of God is nothing to him; and ſo it can have no influence upon him for the quieting of his heart under troubles: and as to <hi>the ſecond,</hi> the advancement of his own good, he, not being in Covenant with God (on which the ſanctification of all Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces doth depend) can have no aſſurance of this; and therefore cannot from this fetch that which may quiet and comfort him: but both of theſe have their full power and ſtrength where grace is, and thereupon it becomes an effectual means to contentment.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, <hi>In the general habit of Grace there are contained certain ſpecial Graces which do very much further Contentment.</hi> I'le inſtance in <hi>Humility, Faith, Repentance, Heavenly-mindedneſs, Self-denyal.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Humility.</hi> The humble man is alwayes a contented man, the proud man is alwayes of a contrary temper. <hi>Pride</hi> puts us upon <hi>contending</hi> with God, <hi>Humility</hi> upon <hi>yielding</hi> and <hi>ſubmitting</hi> to him. <hi>Pride</hi> makes us think we are wiſer than God, can order our conditions better than he; <hi>Humility</hi> dreads this heart-blaſphemy. <hi>Pride</hi> muſt be at the top of the pinacle, no condition, no mercy is high enough for it, a proud perſon cannot bear a low ſtate, he looks upon himſelf, as wronged if he be not chief (as he ſaid to his Daughter, <hi>Si non dominaris injuriam te accipere exiſtimas:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Sueton.</note>) Humility accepts of the loweſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and the loweſt mercy; Oh! (ſaith the humble perſon) what can be <hi>too low</hi> for me who deſerve to be in H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Matth.</hi> 8.24, &amp;c. Truly the calming of the heart in its inward ſtorms is a thing every way as marvellous as what Chriſt here did; and that which requires as great a power to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. If therefore you deſire to arrive at this even temper of mind in
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:95740:345"/> every condition, often go to God and beg it of him: Say, <q>Lord, I have a Peeviſh, froward diſcontented heart, that is ready upon every croſs to vex and fret againſt thee: this I hope is my burden, I would fain have it otherwiſe; but I cannot get victory over my paſſion, I cannot bring my ſelf to a calm and ſubmiſſive frame: wherefore I ſeek to thee to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able me thereunto.

Let us bring it down to our ſelves. <hi>Paul</hi> had learnt in <hi>every ſtate</hi> to be content; we have ſcarce learnt in <hi>any ſtate</hi> to be content: We are not well either <hi>full</hi> or <hi>faſting:</hi> When it's Summer then 'tis too hot, when 'tis winter then 'tis too cold. Every condition is (more or leſs) uneaſie to us. If it be Mercy we complain it is not <hi>enough,</hi> if affliction we complain 'tis <hi>too much;</hi> and ſo we are alwayes <hi>in ſtatu querulo &amp; moroſo</hi> (as he in <hi>Seneca</hi> expreſſeth it.) The great God is willing to be pleaſed with what we do, but how hard are we to be pleaſed with what he doth? He finds no fault with our <hi>duties</hi> (though at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many defects) if done in ſincerity; we will be finding fault with his <hi>Providences</hi> (though there be nothing in them but what ſpeaks infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs.) The generality of men carry it as if the <hi>fretting leproſie</hi> was upon them; yea many, even of thoſe who belong to God, are too much ſick of this diſeaſe. Surely if he was not a long-ſuffering and compaſſionate Father, he would not bear as he doth with ſuch froward Children. The moſt like their inward ſtate <hi>too well,</hi> and their outward ſtate <hi>too ill.</hi> Such who have the world are contented without God, Such who have God are not contented without the world.</p>
            <p>It being thus, is it not highly neceſſary that we ſhould for the time to come ſet our ſelves with our utmoſt diligence to get a Contented ſpirit? May be, we dare not let the fire of our paſſion break forth; but it lies ſmothering and hid in the heart; when ſhall it be quite extinguiſhed? oh that that might be wholly caſt out, and that inſtead thereof, ſedateneſs of mind, ſubmiſſion to God, contentation in every condition, might come in into the ſoul! My Brethren, will you fall upon the ſtudying of this excellent leſſon of Contentment? You have learnt nothing in Chriſtianity till you have learnt this: you are no better than <hi>Abcedarians</hi> in Religion if you have not maſtered this great piece of practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal knowledg. You have <hi>heard</hi> much, <hi>read</hi> much of contentment, but have you <hi>learnt</hi> it ſo as to live in the daily practice of it? pray take up with nothing ſhort of that.</p>
            <pb n="669" facs="tcp:95740:345"/>

            <p n="2">2. Inſenſibility of heart is an eminent degree of deſpiſing the Lord's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenings. A penſive feeling of judgments is very congruous, whether we conſider them <hi>in genere Phyſico</hi> or <hi>Morali;</hi> either materially as afflictive to nature, or as the ſigns of divine diſpleaſure: for the affections were planted in the humane nature by the hand of God himſelf, and are duly exerciſed in proportion to the quality of their objects. And when grace comes it ſoftens the breaſt, and gives a quick and tender ſenſe of God's frown. An eminent inſtance we have in <hi>David;</hi> though of heroical courage, yet in his ſad aſcent to mount <hi>Olivet,</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 15.30.</note> he went up weeping with his head covered and his feet bare, to teſtifie his humble and ſubmiſſive ſenſe of God's an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger againſt him. Now when men are inſenſible of judgments either conſidered as natural or penal evils, if when they ſuffer the loſs of relations or other trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles they preſently fly to the comforts of the Heathens, that we are all mortal, and what can't be help't muſt be endured, without the ſenſe humanity requires, that calm is like that of the dead ſea a real curſe: or ſuppoſe natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affection works a little, yet there is no apprehenſion and concernment for God's diſpleaſure, which ſhould be infinitely more affecting than any out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward trouble how ſharp ſoever, no ſerious deep humiliation under his hand, no yielding up our ſelves to his management, this moſt juſtly provokes him. Of this temper were thoſe deſcribed by <hi>Jeremiah,</hi>

            <p n="2">2. The cauſes of this deſpiſeing of God's chaſtenings are,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) A contracted ſtupidity of ſoul, proceeding from a courſe in ſin. There is a natural ſtubborneſs and contumacy in the heart againſt God, a vicious quality derived from rebellious <hi>Adam: we are all hewn out of the rock, and dig'd out of the quary,</hi> and this is one of the worſt effects of ſin, and a great part of its deceitfulneſs, that by ſtealth it encreaſeth the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hardneſs,<note place="margin">Heb. 3.13. Zech. 7.12.</note> by degrees it creeps on like a gangrene, and cauſes an indolen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. The practice of ſin makes the heart like an adamant the hardeſt of ſtones that exceeds that of rocks. For hence proceeds ſuch unteach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs of the mind, that when God ſpeaks and ſtrikes yet ſinners will not be convinc't; that briars and thorns are only effectual to teach them; and ſuch untractableneſs in the will, that when the ſinner is ſtormed by affliction, and ſome light breaks into the underſtanding, yet it refuſeth to obey God's call.</p>

Carnal diverſions are another cauſe of ſlighting God's hand.<note place="margin">Luke 21.34.</note> The plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and cares of the world as they render men inapprehenſive of judgments to come, ſo regardleſs of thoſe that are preſent. Some whenever they feel the ſmart of a croſs, uſe all the arts of oblivion to loſe the ſenſe of it. The affliction inſtead of a leading them to repentance, leads them to vain converſations, to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies and other ſinful delights to drive away ſorrow. Others although they do not venture upon forbidden things to relieve their melancholy, yet when God by ſhort and ſenſible admonitions calls upon them, they have preſently recourſe to temporal comforts, which although lawful and innocent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, yet are as unproper at that time, as the taking of a cordial when a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit begins to work: for whereas chaſtiſements are ſent to awaken and affect us by conſidering our ſins in their bitter fruits, this unſeaſonable application of ſenſual comforts wholly defeats God's deſign. For nothing ſo much hinders ſerious conſideration as a voluptuous indulging the ſenſes in things pleaſing; like opiate medicines they ſtupifie the conſcience and benum the heart. 'Tis <hi>Solomon's</hi> expreſſion, <hi>I ſaid of laughter it is mad:</hi> for as diſtraction breaks the connexion of the thoughts, ſo mirth ſhuffles our moſt ſerious thoughts into diſorder, and cauſes men to paſs over their troubles without reflexion and remorſe.</p>

There is a paſſive malignity in all, an unaptneſs to be wrought on and to receive ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and Heavenly impreſſions from God's hand; but in ſome of the ſons of perdition there is an active malignity whereby they furiouſly repel judgments as if they could oppoſe the almighty. Their hearts are of an anvil-temper, made harder by afflictions and reverberate the blow: like that <hi>Roman</hi> Emperor who inſtead of humbling and reforming at God's voice in thunder thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred back again. All judgments that befall them are as ſtrokes given to wild beaſts, that inſtead of taming them enrage them to higher degrees of fierceneſs.<note place="margin">Iſai. 3.9, 10.</note> The Prophet deſcribed ſome of this rank of ſinners, who ſaid in the pride and ſtoutneſs of their hearts, the bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn ſtones, the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comores are cut down, but we will change them into Cedars: And thus many, though not explicity, yet vertually declare a reſolution, notwithſtanding the moſt viſible diſcouragements from Heaven, to proceed in their ſinful courſes with more greedineſs, and from a ſullen ſecret athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm are more ſtrongly carried to gratifie their luſts when they are in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>

In this notion the Apoſtle in the 12 verſe, <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts them to lift up the hands that hang down, and ſtrengthen the feeble knees:</hi> That is to encourage and ſtrengthen their ſouls by a real belief of the promiſes made to afflicted Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It may reſpect the ſinking, and falling away of the ſoul like water, being hopeleſs of overcoming troubles.

            <p>The cauſes of this deſpondency are uſually,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Either the kind of the affliction: when there is a ſingularity in the caſe, it increaſeth the apprehenſion of God's diſpleaſure, becauſe it may ſignifie an extraordinary guilt, and ſingular unworthineſs in the perſon that ſuffers, and upon that account the ſorrow ſwells ſo high as to overwhelm him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The number and degrees of afflictions: when like thoſe black clouds which in winter days joyn together and quite intercept the beams of the ſun, many troubles meet at once, and deprive us of all preſent comfort. <hi>Job</hi> loſt his children by a ſudden unnatural death; and was tormented in all the parts of his body, and reduced from his rich abundance to the dunghil and a pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſherd to ſcrape his boils.

            <p>The next thing is to prove that 'tis the duty and wiſdom of the afflicted not to deſpiſe the chaſtenings of the Lord, nor to faint under them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. 'Tis their duty carefully to avoid thoſe extreams, becauſe they are very diſhonourable to God.</p>

               <pb n="675" facs="tcp:95740:348"/>1. The contempt of chaſtiſements is a high profanation of God's honour, who is our Father and Soveraign, and in that quality afflicts us: 'Tis our Apoſtle's argument, Furthermore <hi>we have had fathers of our fleſh,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Heb. 12.9.</note> 
               <hi>which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected us, and we gave them reverence, ſhall we not much more be ſubject to the Father of Spirits, and live?</hi> 'Tis a principle deeply planted in the humane nature, which the moſt barbarous Nations have kept inviolable, to expreſs humble reſpects to our Parents, from whom we derive our life, and by whoſe tender care we have been preſerved, and educated, although their diſcipline be rigorous: But it is infinitely more juſt and reaſonable, that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verently ſubmit to the Father of Spirits, who hath the higheſt right in us. As much as the immortal ſpirit excels the infirm corruptible fleſh, proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably ſhould our reverence to God, when he moſt ſharply rebukes us, exceed our reſpects to our earthly fathers when they correct us. The manner of the Apoſtle's expreſſion is very ſignificant, <hi>Shall we not much rather?</hi> if there be any vital ſpark of conſcience remaining in our breaſts; if reaſon be not whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declined to brutiſhneſs, we cannot do otherwiſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fainting under chaſtenings reflects diſhonourably upon God. 'Tis true in ſome reſpect, thoſe who are extremely dejected are not ſo guilty as the deſpiſers; for uſually they acknowledge the order and juſtice of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. But that falſe conception of the Father of mercies, either that he <hi>willingly afflicts the children of men,</hi> or that he hates them, becauſe he afflicts them here, is ſo contrary to his holy nature, and injurious to his goodneſs,<note place="margin">1 Joh 4.9.</note> the ſpecial Character of his nature, that 'tis an equal provocation, with the ſlighting his Soveraignty.</p>
            <p>'Tis the beſt wiſdom not to deſpiſe God's chaſtenings, nor faint under them: I will not inſiſt upon the conſideration, that 'tis the counſel of the ſupreme wiſdom to us, nor that 'tis the avoiding the vicious extremes, which is the chiefeſt point of moral prudence; but it is the only way to prevent the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt miſchiefs that will otherwiſe befal us. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>He that is Wiſe is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to himſelf,</hi> that is, either in obtaining good, or preventing evils.<note place="margin">Job 22.21.</note> Now it will appear how pernicious thoſe extremes are, by conſidering,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The contempt of chaſtenings deprives us of all thoſe benefits which were intended by them. God's end in them is to imbitter ſin to our taſt, and make us diſrelliſh that deadly poyſon: for as according to the rules of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſick, contraries are cured by contraries; ſo ſin, that prevails by pleaſure, by ſomething delightful to the carnal part, is mortified by what is afflictive to ſenſe. Repentance is a duty that beſt complies with affliction: for when the ſpirit is roade ſad, and brought to the ſobriety of conſideration, it will more readily reflect upon the true cauſes of troubles: when the ſprings overflow, 'tis but directing the ſtream into a right channel, the changing the object of our grief, <hi>viz.</hi> mourning for ſin inſtead of ſorrowing for outward trouble, and we are in the way to happineſs. Senſible ſorrow leads to Godly ſorrow. <hi>The natural is firſt, then the ſpiritual.</hi> Now the deſpiſers of God's hand, that are unaffected with judgments, are incapable of this benefit. For if they do not feel the blow, how ſhall they take notice of the hand that ſtrikes? if they are not ſoftened with ſorrows, how ſhall they receive the divine impreſſion? if they have no ſenſe of his diſpleaſure, how ſhall they fear to offend him for
<pb n="676" facs="tcp:95740:349"/> the future? if the medicine doth not work, how can it expel noxious humors?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The neglect of chaſtenings doth not only render them unprofitable, but expoſes to greater evils.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It provokes God to withdraw his judgments for a time. This the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner deſired, and thinks himſelf happy that he is at eaſe: miſerable deluſion! 1. This reſpite is the preſage of his final ruine. 'Twas the deſperate ſtate of <hi>Judah,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Iſa. 1.5.</note> as God expreſſes it, <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtriken any more? ye will revolt more and more:</hi> The words of an anxious Father that has tryed all methods, counſel, kindneſs, corrections, to reclaim a rebellious obſtinate ſon, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no anſwerable effect gives him over, to follow the pernicious ſwing of his corrupt deſires. No ſeverity is like the ſuffering him in his licentious courſes. Thus when God hath uſed many gracious wayes to reduce the ſinner by his Word, Spirit, and judgments, but he is inflexible to the calls of the Word, impenetrable to the motions of the Spirit, and inſenſible of afflicting provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, when after a combat with the rod ſin comes off unwounded, and the rod retires; this calm is more dreadful than the fierceſt ſtorm: Nothing can be more fatal to the ſinner; for by this divine deſertion he is given over to a reprobate mind and vile affections, he goes on undiſturbed in his ſins, and every day increaſeth his enmity againſt God, and provokes God's enmity againſt him. 'Tis not conceivable that one who is not made pliable to the grace of God by afflictions, ſhould ſubmit when he is in pleaſant circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and diſpos'd to enjoy ſenſual ſatisfactions. If the whip and ſpur cannot break and tame the unruly beaſt, certainly the rich paſture will never make him manageable. So that God's ceaſing to puniſh the ſinner at preſent is ſo far from being a favour, that
'tis the effect of his deepeſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; for it contributes to his hardning. 'Twas the caſe of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> when any of the plagues were removed, indulgence occaſioned his indura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As water taken from the fire freezes ſooner and harder, becauſe the thinner parts are evaporated by the former heat, ſo when men are taken off from the fire of affliction, they are more confirmed in their vicious courſes, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>han if they had never been afflicted.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſlighting of lighter ſtrokes provokes God ſometimes to bring more dreadful judgments in this life upon ſinners. No man can endure that his love or anger ſhould be deſpiſed. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> commanded the furnace to be heated ſeven times hotter for thoſe who contemned his threatnings.<note place="margin">Lev. 26.23, 24</note> God tells the <hi>Iſraelites, If ye will not be reformed by me by theſe things, but will walk contrary unto me, then will I alſo walk contrary unto you, and will puniſh you yet ſeven times more for your ſins.</hi> He will change the rods into ſcorpions, and ſcourge them for their continued rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.<note place="margin">Amos 3.5.</note> 'Tis the intent of that expoſtulation, <hi>Shall one take up a ſnare from the earth, and have taken nothing at all?</hi> Shall God remove his judgments while ſinners are careleſs and unreformed, as if they might be final conquerers over them? no, he will multiply and greaten them. It may be at firſt God blaſts part of the eſtate, and the ſinner is not apprehenſive of his hand; then he comes nearer and ſnatches away a dear relation; if ſtill the ſinner is unaffected, he ſtrikes his body with a lingring or acute diſeaſe; if ſtill he be not concern'd
<pb n="677" facs="tcp:95740:349"/> for God's diſpleaſure, he wounds his ſpirit, makes him ſick in ſenſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience at the ſame time, fills him with terror by the reflection upon his wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed wayes, and the foreſight of that dreadful Tribunal before which he muſt appear: So that although he cannot live, he dare not die; though his earthly tabernacle be ready to fall upon him, he is afraid to go out and meet the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Judge. And if this doth not work a ſincere thorow change, God caſts him into hell to the company of the Giants,<note place="margin">Prov. 21.16. Vid. <hi>Mr. Mede</hi> in loc.</note> thoſe bold rebels that fought againſt God. Briefly, as under the law, an incorrigible ſon that neglected his father's reproofs was to die without mercy, ſo an unreformed ſinner who kicks againſt the pricks, and refuſes to ſubmit to God's corrections, ſhall be cut off in his obſtinacy. Juſtice will proceed to exciſion, and acts of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance againſt him.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Fainting under chaſtenings is pernicious to ſufferers: for it renders them utterly indiſpoſed for the performance of duty, and uncapable of receiving the comforts proper for an afflicted ſtate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It renders them utterly indiſpoſed for the performance of duty. Hope draws forth all the active powers of the ſoul, 'tis the great motive to diligence, and inſtrument of duty: Deſpair, like extremity of cold that checks the ſpring, and binds up the earth that its fruits cannot appear, hinders the free exerciſe of reaſon and grace, and cuts the ſinews of obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. He that is hopeleſs of a good iſſue out of troubles, will neither repent, nor pray, nor reform, but indulges barren tears inſtead of real duties.</p>
            <p>Beſides it often falls out, that the ſame affliction is ſent from God's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure upon his people for their ſins, and is the effect of the rage of men againſt them, upon the account of their profeſſing his Name. Such is the Wiſdom and Goodneſs of God, that by the ſame fiery tryal he may refine his ſervants from their droſs and impurities, and render the Glory of the Goſpel more <hi>Conſpicuous.</hi> The hatred of Religion, and a blind fury may tranſport men to acts of Cruelty againſt the Saints, but 'tis by the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the univerſal Soveraign, who hath the hearts of all in his hands, and ſuffers their rage for holy ends. The enemy deſignes againſt their Faith, but God's aim is to make them change their lives. Now if either through ſtrong fears, or the ſtinging ſenſe of troubles, upon the account of Religion, our Courage fails, we are preſently in danger of falling away, and denying our Maſter. The faint-hearted perſon is uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally falſe-hearted, and for want of reſolution, being frighted out of his Conſcience and duty, chooſes ſin rather than ſuffering, and thereby juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deprives himſelf <hi>of the Crown of life,</hi> that is promiſed only to <hi>thoſe who are Faithful unto the death.</hi> Beſides not only the loſs of heaven, but the torments of hell, are threaten'd againſt thoſe who withdraw from the ſervice of God to avoid temporal evils.<note place="margin">Rev. 21.8.</note> The <hi>fearful and unbelieving are in the front of thoſe that ſhall have part in the lake of fire and brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, which is the ſecond death.</hi> Now what folly is it, when two evils are propounded, to chooſe the greateſt; that is, eternal death rather than temporal? and of two goods, to prefer the leſs; a ſhort life with its Conveniencies on earth, before that which is eternally glorious in heaven?
<pb n="678" facs="tcp:95740:350"/> By which it appears, how much it concerns us to fortifie and fix our minds, by a ſtedfaſt belief of God's ſupporting preſence with us in all troubles, and of his gracious promiſe, that in due time we ſhall reap, if we faint not in well-doing.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They are incapable of the Comforts proper to an afflicted ſtate. Thoſe ariſe from the apprehenſion <hi>that God loves whom he chaſtens:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rev. 3.</note> for the leaſt ſin is a greater evil than the greateſt trouble, and his deſign is to take that away, and from the expectation of a happy iſſue. Hope is the anchor within the vail, that in the midſt of ſtorms and the rougheſt ſeas preſerves from ſhipwrack. The character of Chriſtians is,<note place="margin">Rom. 12.12.</note> that they <hi>are rejoycing in hope:</hi> But when the afflicted are under fearful impreſſions that God is an irreconcileable enemy, and ſadly conclude their miſeries are paſt redreſs, thoſe divine Comforts that are able to ſweeten the moſt bitter ſufferings to believers are of no efficacy; their deep ſorrows are not like the pains of a travelling woman, that end in a joyful birth, but the killing tortures of the ſtone, that are fruitleſs to the patient. An obſtinate grief and rejecting the Conſolations of God, <hi>is the beginning of ſorrows,</hi> the firſt payment of that ſad arrear of mourning that ſhall be exacted in another world.</p>
            <p>The Uſe ſhall be to excite us to thoſe duties that are directly contrary to the extremes forbidden, <hi>viz.</hi> to demean our ſelves under the chaſtenings of the Lord, with a deep reverence and humble fear of his diſpleaſure, and with a firm hope and dependance upon him for a bleſſed iſſue, upon our complying with his holy Will.</p>
            <p n="1">1. With a humble reverence of his hand. This temper is abſolutely neceſſary, and moſt congruous with reſpect to God, upon the account of his Soveraign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Juſtice and Goodneſs, declar'd in his chaſtenings; and with reſpect to our frailty, our dependance upon him, our obnoxiouſneſs to his Law, and our obligations to him, that he will pleaſe to afflict us for our good.</p>
            <p>This is the reaſon of that expoſtulation, <hi>Will the Lion roar in the forreſt when he hath no prey?</hi> Shall God's threatenings and judgments have no effect? Who ever hardened himſelf againſt him and proſpered?<note place="margin">Amos 3.4.</note>

               <hi>He ſtretches out his hand againſt God, and ſtrengthens himſelf againſt the Almighty, he runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick boſſes of his bucklers.</hi> Such a furious rebel was <hi>Ahaz,</hi> who in the time of his diſtreſs did treſpaſs more againſt the Lord; <hi>This is that King Ahaz.</hi> But God hath moſt ſolemnly declared, that he will be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorious at laſt over the moſt fierce obdurate enemies.<note place="margin">2 Chron. 28.</note> 
               <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord, every knee ſhall bow to me.</hi> His power is infinite, and anger puts an edge upon his power, and makes it more terrible. If our ſubjection be not voluntary, it muſt be violent. 'Tis our wiſdom to prevent acts of venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by humble ſubmiſſions. The duty of the afflicted is excellently expreſt by <hi>Elihu:</hi>
               <note place="margin">Job 34.31, 32</note> 
               <hi>Surely it is meet to be ſaid to God, I have born chaſtiſements, I will
<pb n="679" facs="tcp:95740:350"/> not offend any more: that I know not teach thou me, if I have done iniquity I will do ſo no more.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Add further, upon another account reverence is due to God's chaſtenings: for when love is the motive that incites one to give us counſel, though it be mixt with reproofs, and his prudence is not great, yet a reſpect is due to the affection. Now God who is only wiſe, chaſtiſes men from a deſire to make them better and happy: he intends primarily to refine, not to conſume them by afflictions; ſo that a ſerious regard to his hand is the moſt juſt and neceſſary duty of the creature. Briefly, every chaſtiſement ſhould leave deep and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent impreſſions upon us, the ſenſe of God's diſpleaſure ſhould make our hearts mournful and mollified, broken and contrite, that his will may be done by us on earth as
'tis in heaven.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let us alway preſerve an humble dependance and firm hope on God for a bleſſed iſſue out of all our troubles: The ſupport and tranquillity of the ſoul ariſeth from hence; Chriſtian patience ſuffers all things as well as charity, being encouraged by a continual expectation of good from him. Patience confirms all other graces, and is to the whole armour of God, what the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per is to material weapons, that keeps them from breaking in the combat: Now to maintain a conſtant hope in affliction, 'tis neceſſary to conſider the reaſon of the Exhortation, as 'tis admirably amplified by the Apoſtle.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The relation God ſuſtains when he afflicts believers. He is a Judge in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with the quality of a Father. The Covenant of grace between God and Jeſus Chriſt, our true <hi>David,</hi> contains this obſervable cauſe, <hi>If thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren forſake my law, and walk not in my judgments, if they break my ſtatutes,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 89.30, 31, 32.</note>

               <note place="margin">Deut. 8.5.</note> 
               <hi>that as a man chaſtens his ſon, ſo the Lord thy God chaſtens thee.</hi> In children reaſon is not fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clouded, they are not capable to govern themſelves, and are only taught with ſenſible pleaſure or pain; ſo that a father is obliged to joyn correction with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction to form them to vertue. This is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with paternal affection, that 'tis inſeparable from it. For a parent to ſuffer a child to go on pleaſantly in ſin without due puniſhment is pure cruelty diſguiſed under the mask of pity; for by the neglect of diſcipline he is confirm'd in his vicious courſes, and expoſed to ruine. The Apoſtle therefore adds, <hi>Whom the Lord loves he chaſtens.</hi> As from the ſevereſt wrath he ſometimes forbeareth to ſtrike, ſo from deareſt love he afflicts. Humble believers through a cloud of tears may ſee the light of God's countenance; for having elected them by ſpecial love to a glorious inheritance above, he diſpenſeth all things here in order to the preparing them for it, and all temporal evils as means are tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd into the nature of the end to which they are ſubſervient.

Indeed there is hardly any kind of affliction that may befal us, but we have ſome inſtance in Scripture of the Saints ſuffering the ſame.

Are our dear relations taken away? <hi>Aaron</hi> and <hi>David</hi> loſt ſome of their ſons by terrible ſtrokes.

How many torments in one death? Yet they were ſo far from fainting, that the more their pains were exaſperated, the more their courage and joy was ſhining and conſpicuous; as the face of the heavens is never more ſerene and clear, than when the ſharpeſt north-wind blows.

The Apoſtle repreſents the ſpecial prerogative of God as the Father of Spirits, and ſo hath a nearer claim to us than the fathers of our fleſh, and that he is not liable to thoſe imperfections that attend the earthly relations. <hi>They for a few dayes chaſtened us for their own pleaſure;</hi> humane love is a troubled irregular paſſion, mixt with ignorance and prone to errour in the exceſs or defect.

But in God there is a perfect union of wiſdom and love, of diſcretion and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs; his affection is without the leaſt imperfection, his will is alwayes
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:95740:354"/> guided by infinite wiſdom.

            <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle ſpecifies the immediate end of God in his chaſtenings: <hi>But he for our profit, that we may be partakers of his holineſs.</hi> This is the ſupreme excellency of the divine nature; and our conformity to it is ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable, that it renders afflictions not only tolerable, but ſo far deſirable, as they contribute to it. In the preſent ſtate our graces are imperfect, and our conformity to the divine purity is like the reſemblance of the Sun in a watery cloud, very much beneath the perfection and radiation of that great light. Now God is pleaſed to faſhion us according to his image by afflictions, as a ſtatue is cut by the Artificer, to bring it into a beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful form. He is pleaſed to bring us into divers temptations to try our faith, to work in us patience, to inflame our prayers, to mortifie our carnal deſires, to break thoſe voluntary bands whereby we are fettered to the earth, that we may live with thoſe afflictions wherewith others die. And certainly if we make a true judgment of things, we have not the leaſt cauſe to ſuſpect the love of God, when he chaſtiſes us to take away ſin, the only abominable object of his hatred and deep deteſtation, and to render us partakers of the divine nature. And the <hi>preſent peaceable fruit of righteouſneſs</hi> is the product in thoſe who are duly exerciſed by their troubles. It is an alluſion to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the conquerers in the Olympick games, who had a crown of Olives, the embleme and ſhadow of peace. But true peace, a divine calm in the conſcience, ſhall be the recompence of all that exerciſe the graces ſuitable to an afflicted ſtate. In ſhort, the Apoſtle aſſures Believers,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.32.</note> that they are chaſtened of the Lord, to prevent their condemnation with the world. 'Tis this rod truely delivers them from hell, 'tis this conſideration that changes thorns into roſes, and extracts honey out of worm-wood. If the way be ſtony or flowry that leads to bleſſedneſs, a Chriſtian ſhould willingly walk in it. To conclude, from the conſideration of what the Scripture declares concerning temporal evils, <hi>Let us lift up the hands that hang down, and the feeble knees, and make ſtraight paths for our feet, leſt that which is lame be turned out of the way, but let it rather be healed,</hi> i. e. in our affliction let us take courage and reſolution from the promiſes, and live in a holy confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God's will, that the weak or faint may be reſtored.</p>

'Tis impoſſible a perſon ſhould be a Chriſtian, and be incapable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in the moſt afflicted ſtate, for we are really ſo by the holy Spirit who is the Comforter. When we ſpeak ſometimes to thoſe we judge infirm, we ſpeak to Infidels, who only receive remedy from time, which they ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive from Faith; they have the Name of God only in their mouths, but the world is in their hearts; their paſſions are ſtrong and obſtinate, not ſubject to ſanctified reaſon; the difficulty they have of being comforted, diſcovers the neceſſity of their being afflicted; they need converſion more than conſolation. Others who are ſincere in the Faith, yet are apt to faint under troubles, from an errour, like that of the Apoſtles, when their Lord came upon the waters in a ſtormy tempeſtuous night to their aſſiſtance, they though he was a ſpirit; ſo they look on God as an enemy, when he comes to ſanctifie and ſave them. The ſoveraign remedy of our ſorrows is to correct the judgment of ſenſe by a ſerious belief of God's promiſe; thus we ſhall reconcile the roughneſs of his hand with the ſweetneſs of his voice: He calls to us from heaven in the darkeſt night, 'tis I, be not afraid; he corrects us with the heart and hand of a Father.

That he might be preſerved from a liking of, or a longing after thoſe things, which are the baits and allurements whereby men are apt to be drawn into Societies and Conſpiracies with the workers of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity; <hi>And let me not eat of their Dainties.</hi> See <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10, 11, 12, 13, 14. For he here deſcribeth the condition of men proſpering for a ſeaſon in a courſe of wickedneſs: They firſt joyntly give up themſelves unto the practice of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and then together ſolace themſelves in thoſe Satisfactions of their Luſts, which their power and intereſt in the world do furniſh them withal.</p>
            <p>Theſe are the <hi>Dainties,</hi> of which an impotent longing and deſire do betray the minds of unſtable Perſons unto a Compliance with wayes of ſin and folly: for I look on theſe <hi>Dainties</hi> to compriſe whatever the Luſt of the eyes, the Luſt of the fleſh, or the pride of life can afford. All theſe <hi>David</hi> prays to be delivered from any inclination unto; eſpecially when they are made the Allurements of a courſe of ſin. In the enjoyment of theſe <hi>Dainties,</hi> it is the common practice of wicked men to ſooth up, approve of, and mutually encourage one another in the way and courſe wherein they are engaged. And this compleats that goodly felicity which in this world ſo many aſpire unto, and whereof alone they are capable. The whole of it is but a Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in periſhing ſenſual enjoyments, without controll, and with mutual Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes from one another.</p>
            <p>This the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> had a ſpecial regard unto; who caſting his eye towards another Communion and Society which he longed after, <hi>v.</hi> 5. that in the firſt place preſents it ſelf unto him, which is moſt oppoſite unto thoſe mutual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſes and rejoycings in one another, which is the ſalt and cement of all evil Societies; namely Rebukes and Reproofs for the leaſt miſcarriages that ſhall be obſerved. Now whereas the <hi>Dainties,</hi> which ſome enjoy in a courſe of proſperous wickedneſs, are that alone which ſeems to have any thing in it amongſt them that is deſirable; and on the other ſide Rebukes and Reproofs are thoſe alone which ſeem to have any ſharpneſs, or matter of uneaſineſs and diſlike in the Society of the godly, <hi>David</hi> ballanceth that which ſeemeth to be <hi>ſharpeſt</hi> in the one Society, againſt that which ſeems to be <hi>ſweeteſt</hi> in the

               </gap> is ſeldom uſed in the Scripture, but to ſignifie a ſevere Stroke which ſhakes the Subject ſmitten, and cauſeth it to tremble. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.25. 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.6. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 74.6. And as it is uſed for the ſtroke of the Hammer on the Anvil in faſhioning of the Iron, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 41.7. Wherefore the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> following may be taken adverbially as a Lenitive of that Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity which this word importeth. <hi>Let him ſmite me;</hi> but <hi>Leniter, Benigne, Miſericorditer:</hi> Gently, Kindly, Friendly, Mercifully; And ſo ſome Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlations read the words; <hi>Let the Righteous ſmite me friendly, or kindly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But there is no need to wreſt the word to ſuch unuſual ſenſe; for the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> intends to ſhew, that ſo he may be delivered from the Society of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, and enjoy the Communion of the Righteous, he would not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precate the greateſt ſeverities, which according to Rule, might be exerciſed in rebuking, or reproving of him. And this he doth with ſo full a ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of mind, with ſuch an high valuation of the advantage he ſhould have thereby, that he ſays not he would bear it patiently and quietly, but <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> it will be unto me a Benignity, a Mercy, a Kindneſs, as the word imports. And as it ſeems that ſome reproofs, at leaſt ſome regular dealings of Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſons with us, may come as a ſtroke that makes us ſhake and tremble; ſo it is a good advance in Spiritual Wiſdom, to find out kindneſs and mercy in thoſe that are ſo grievous unto our natural ſpirits, unto Fleſh and Blood.</p>

               <pb n="686" facs="tcp:95740:357"/> in the foregoing words. It is <hi>reproofs</hi> that he intends; and theſe he calls ſmiting in oppoſition unto the flattering, compliance of wicked men with one another in the enjoyment of their <hi>Dainties,</hi> and with reſpect unto that ſmart unto the mind and Affections, wherewith ſome of them are ſometimes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied.

               </gap> Theſe words have a double Interpretation; for they may be either deprecatory of an evil implied, or declaratory of the <hi>Pſalmiſt's</hi> ſenſe of the good he deſired. <hi>Kimchi</hi> on the place obſerves, that his Father <hi>Joſeph</hi> divided the words of the Text, and began here a new ſenſe, wherein the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> returns unto the cloſe of the fourth verſe; <hi>Let me not eat of their Dainties,</hi> and <hi>let not their precious Oyl,</hi> that is, their flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries and ſoothings in ſin, <hi>break my Head;</hi> but let the Reproofs of the Righteous preſerve me.

            <p>The laſt clauſe of the words belonging not unto our preſent deſign, I ſhall not inſiſt on their explication.</p>
            <p>Some few things muſt be further premiſed unto our Principal intention, concerning the nature of thoſe <hi>Reproofs</hi> which are propoſed as a matter of ſuch Advantage in the Text. And,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> here uſed, ſignifieth to <hi>Argue,</hi> to <hi>Diſpute,</hi> to <hi>Contend</hi> in judgment, as well as to <hi>reprove,</hi> rebuke, or reprehend. Its firſt ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is to <hi>Argue,</hi> or to plead a Cauſe with Arguments. Hence it is uſed as a Common Term between God and man, denoting the Reaſons real or pretended only on the one ſide and the other. So God himſelf ſpeaks unto his People <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> 
               <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1.18. <hi>Go to now and let us Plead,</hi> reaſon, or argue together. And <hi>Job</hi> calls his Pleas, or Argument in Prayer unto God <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> Chap. 23.4. <hi>I would fill my mouth with Arguments.</hi> Wherefore that only hath the true Nature of a Reproof, which is accompanied with Reaſons and Arguments for the evincing of what it tends unto. Raſh,
<pb n="687" facs="tcp:95740:357"/> groundleſs, wrathful precipitate Cenſures and rebukes are evil in themſelves; and, in our preſent caſe, of no Conſideration. Nor indeed ought any one to engage in the Management of Reproofs, who is not furniſhed with Rule and Argument to evince their neceſſity, and render them effectual. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times things may be ſo Circumſtanced, as that a Reproof ſhall ſo carry its own Reaſon and efficacious Conviction along with it, as that there will be no need of arguing, or Pleas to make it uſeful. So the look of our Bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour on <hi>Peter</hi> under the Circumſtances of his caſe, was a ſufficient Reproof, though he ſpake not one word in its Confirmation. But ordinarily Cogent Reaſons are the beſt conveyances of Reproofs to the minds of men, be they of what ſort they will.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reproofs do alwayes reſpect a <hi>Fault,</hi> an evil, a miſcarriage, or a ſin in them that are reproved. There may be mutual admonitions, and exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations among Chriſtians, with reſpect unto ſundry things in the courſe of their Faith and Obedience, without a regard unto any evil or miſcarriage. The general nature of a Reproof is an admonition, or exhortation, but it hath its ſpecial nature from its regard unto a fault in Courſe, or particular fact. And hence the word ſignifies alſo to <hi>Chaſtiſe,</hi> wherein is a Correction for, and the means of a recovery from a miſcarriage; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 7.14. <hi>I will reprove him by the Rod of men,</hi> that is, Chaſtiſe him. This therefore is that reproof which we intend, a warning, Admonition, or Exhortation given unto any, whereby they are rebuked for and with reſpect unto ſome moral evil or ſin in their courſe, way, practice, or any particular miſcarriage, ſuch as may render them obnoxious unto Divine Diſpleaſure, or Chaſtiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for it is eſſential unto a regular reproof, that in him who gives it, it may be accompanied with, or do proceed from an apprehenſion, that the perſon reproved is by the matter of the reproof rendred obnoxious unto the diſpleaſure of God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It may alſo be conſidered, that <hi>Reproving</hi> is not leſt arbitrarily unto the wills of men. Whatever ſeems to be ſo, it loſeth its nature, if it be not a duty in him who Reproves, and come ſhort of its efficacy. No wiſe man will reprove, but when it is his Duty ſo to do, unleſs he deſign the juſt reproach of a buſie body for his Reward. The command is general with reſpect unto Brother and Neighbour, <hi>Deut.</hi> 19.17. <hi>Thou ſhalt not hate thy Brother in thine heart; Thou ſhalt in any wiſe rebuke thy Neighbour, and not ſuffer ſin upon him;</hi> But as to the particular diſcharge of this work as a Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, there muſt be either an eſpecial Office, or an eſpecial Relation, or a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of Circumſtances for its warranty. God hath in his wiſdom and care given Rules and bounds unto our Engagement unto Duties; without a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation whereby, we ſhall wander in them with endleſs Diſſatisfactions unto our ſelves, and unneceſſary Provocations unto others. But the Duty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving with the love, wiſdom, tenderneſs and compaſſion required in the diſcharge of it; its Motives, Ends and Circumſtances; its proper Rules and Limitations, fall not under my preſent conſideration; but theſe things in general were neceſſary to be premiſed unto what do ſo,</p>

            <p>That which the Text inſtructs us in may be compriſed in, this general Obſervation,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reproofs, though accompanied with ſome ſharpneſs, if rightly received and duly improved, are a mercy and advantage incomparably above all the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which a joynt conſent with others in ſin and pleaſures can afford.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The latter part of the Propoſition I have mentioned only to expreſs the ballance, that is propoſed by the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> between the beſt and moſt deſirable advantages of wicked ſociety on the one hand, and the ſharpeſt or moſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing ſeverities that accompany the communion of thc Righteous, or god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But I ſhall not at all handle the compariſon, as deſigning only ſome <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections how men ſhould behave themſelves under Reproofs,</hi> that they may be a kindneſs and an Excellent Oyl unto them; or how they may by them obtain Spiritual benefit and Advantage unto their own Souls. And this, however at preſent the matter may be managed, is of it ſelf of great Importance. For as in the ſtate of weakneſs and imperfection, of miſtakes and miſcarria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges wherein we are, there is no outward help or aid of more uſe and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage unto us, than ſeaſonable <hi>Reproofs:</hi> ſo in the right receiving and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving of them, as high a tryal of the ſpirits of men, as to their intereſt in Wiſdom and folly, doth conſiſt, as in any thing that doth befal them, or wherewith they may be exerciſed. For as ſcorners of Reproofs, thoſe that hear them unwillingly, that bear them haughtily and impatiently, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of revenge, or diſdainful Retortions, have the Characters of Pride and Folly indelibly fixed them by the Holy Ghoſt; ſo their due Admiſſion and Improvement is in the ſame infallible Truth repreſented as an evident pledge of wiſdom, and an effectual means of its encreaſe. This is ſo much and ſo frequently inſiſted on in that great Treaſure of all wiſdom, Spiritual, Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and Political, namely, the <hi>Book of Proverbs,</hi> that it is altogether need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs to call over any particular Teſtimonies unto that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Two things we are to enquire into, in compliance with our preſent Deſign.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>How Reproofs may be duly received.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>How they may be duly improved;</hi> whereunto the Reaſons ſhall be added why they ought ſo to be.</p>
            <p n="1">I. That we may <hi>receive Reproofs</hi> in a due manner, three things are to be conſidered. (1) The general <hi>Qualification</hi> of the Reprover; (2) The <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> of the Reproof; And (3) The <hi>matter</hi> of it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> here deſires that his Reprover may be a Righteous man. Let the <hi>Righteous ſmite</hi> me, let him reprove me. To give and take reproofs is a Dictate of the Law of Nature, whereby every man is obliged to ſeek the Good of others, and to promote it according to their ability and oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. The former is directed by that love which is due unto others; the latter by that which is due unto our ſelves: which two are the great Rules, and give meaſure to the Duties of all Societies, whether Civil, or Spiritual. Wherefore it doth not evacuate a Reproof, or Diſcharge him who is repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, from the duty of attending unto it, that he by whom it is managed, is
<pb n="689" facs="tcp:95740:360"/> not <hi>Righteous,</hi> yea is openly wicked; For the Duty it ſelf being an effect of the Law of Nature, it is the ſame, for the ſubſtance of it, by whomſoever it is performed. Yea oft-times ſuch Moral, or rather immoral Qualifications, as render not only the Reprover leſs conſiderable, but alſo the Reproof it ſelf, until thoroughly weighed and examined, obnoxious unto prejudicate Conceptions, do occaſion a greater and more ſignal Exerciſe of Grace and Wiſdom in him that is reproved, than would have been ſtirred up, had all things concurred unto the exact Regularity of the Reproof. However it is deſirable on many accounts, that he who Reproves us be himſelf a Righteous perſon, and be of us eſteemed ſo to be: For as ſuch a one alone will or can have a due ſenſe of the evil reproved, with a right Principle and End in the Diſcharge of his own Duty; ſo the minds of them that are reproved, are by their ſenſe of his Integrity excluded from thoſe inſinuations of evaſions, which prejudices and Suggeſtions of juſt cauſes of Reflections on their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover will offer unto them; eſpecially without the exerciſe of ſingular Wiſdom and humility, will all the Advantages of a juſt Reproof be loſt, where the allowed practice of greater ſins and evils than that Reproved, is daily chargeable on the Reprover. Hence is that Reflection of our Saviour on the uſeleſs, Hypocritical Diligence of men in <hi>pulling the mote out of their Brother's eyes,</hi> whilſt they have <hi>beams</hi> in their own, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.3, 4, 5. The Rule in this Caſe is, <hi>If the Reprover be a Righteous perſon, conſider the Reprover firſt, and then the Reproof; if he be otherwiſe, conſider the Reproof, and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prover not at all.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The <hi>Nature of a Reproof</hi> is alſo to be conſidered; and this is three-fold: for every Reproof is either <hi>Authoritative,</hi> or <hi>Fraternal,</hi> or merely <hi>Friendly</hi> and occaſional.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Authoritative Reproofs</hi> are either (1) <hi>Miniſterial;</hi> or (2) <hi>Parental;</hi> or (3) <hi>Deſpotical.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. There is an eſpecial Authority accompanying Miniſterial Reproofs, which we ought eſpecially to conſider and improve. Now I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not hereby thoſe Doctrinal Reproofs, when in the Diſpenſation of that Word of Grace and Truth, which is <hi>profitable for Correction and Reproof,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. they ſpeak and exhort and <hi>rebuke</hi> the ſins of men <hi>with all Authority,</hi> Tit. 2.15. but the occaſional Application of the Word unto individual perſons upon their unanſwerableneſs in any thing unto the Truth wherein they have been inſtructed. For every Right Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is but the orderly Application of a Rule of Truth unto any Perſon under his miſcarriage, for his healing and recovery. Where therefore a Miniſter of the Goſpel in the Preaching of the Word doth declare and Teach the Rule of Holy obedience with Miniſterial Authority, if any of the Flock committed to his charge ſhall appear in any thing to walk contrary thereunto, or to have tranſgreſſed it in any offenſive Inſtance, as it is his Duty, the diſcharge whereof will be required of him at the great Day, particularly to apply the Truth unto them in the way of private, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Reproof: ſo he is ſtill therein accompanied with his Miniſterial Authority, which makes his Reproof to be of a peculiar nature, and as
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:95740:361"/> ſuch to be accounted for: For as he is thus commanded as a Miniſter to <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort, Rebuke, Admoniſh</hi> and reprove every one of his charge as occaſion ſhall require; ſo in the doing of it he doth diſcharge and Exerciſe his Miniſterial Office and Power. And he that is wiſe will forego no conſiderations, that may give efficacy unto a juſt and due Reproof; eſpecially not ſuch a one as, if it be neglected, will not only be an aggravation of the evil for which he is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, but will alſo accumulate his guilt with a contempt of the Authority of Jeſus Chriſt. Wherefore the Rule here is, <hi>The more clear and evident the repreſentation of the Authority of Chriſt is in the Reproof, the more Dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent ought we to be in our Attendance unto it, and compliance with it.</hi> He is the great Reprover of his Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.19. All the uſe, Power, Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and efficacy of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical</hi> Reproofs, flow Originally and are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from him. In Miniſterial reproofs there is the moſt expreſs and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Application of his Authority made unto the minds of men; which if it be careleſly ſlighted, or proudly deſpiſed, or evacuated by perverſe cavil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, as is the manner of ſome in ſuch caſes, it is an open evidence of an Heart that never yet ſincerely took upon it his Law and Yoke.</p>
            <p>Theſe things are ſpoken of the <hi>Perſonal Repoofs</hi> that are given by Miniſters, principally unto thoſe of their reſpective Flocks, as occaſion doth require, wherein I ſhall pray, that our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Shepherd of the Sheep, would yet make us all more Faithful and diligent, as the ſeaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in we live doth abundantly require it. But moreover Church-cenſures in <hi>Admonition</hi> and <hi>Excommunication</hi> have the nature and ends of Miniſterial reproofs. But the handling of their nature and uſe, with the Duties of thoſe perſons who juſtly fall under them, and the benefit which they may reap thereby, is too long and large a ſubject to be here diverted unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Authoritative reproof is <hi>Parental.</hi> Reproof is indeed one of the greateſt and moſt principal Duties of Parents towards Children, and without which all others for the moſt part do but pamper them unto ſlaughter and Ruine. Neglect hereof is that which hath filled us with ſo many <hi>Hophni's, Phineaſe's,</hi> and <hi>Abſolom's,</hi> whoſe outragious wickedneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are directly charged on the ſinful lenity and neglect in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter even of godly Parents. And indeed whereas ſome Parents are open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vicious and debauched even in the ſight of their Children, in a ſenſual neglect and contempt of the Light of Nature, whereby they loſe all their Authority in reproving, as well as all Care about it; and whereas the moſt have ſo little regard unto ſin as ſin, whilſt things are tolerably well in outward concerns, that they neglect the <hi>reproof</hi> of it as ſuch; and many through a fooliſh contemptible prevalency of fond Affection, will take no notice of the ſinful follies, extravagancies and miſcarriages of their Children, until all things grow deſperate with them; but ſooth up and applaud them in ſuch effects of Pride, Vanity and Wantonneſs, as ought to be moſt ſeverely reproved in them, the woful and dreadful degeneracy of the Age wherein we live owes it ſelf much unto the horrible neglect of Parents in this Duty. <hi>That Parental reproof</hi> is a Duty taught by the
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:95740:361"/> Law of Nature, confirmed in the Scripture, enjoyned under ſevere threatnings and penalties, exemplified in Inſtances of Bleſſings and Vengeance on its Perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance or neglect, rendred indiſpenſably neceſſary by that Depravation of our Natures, which works in Children from the womb, and grows up in ſtrength and efficacy together with them, I ſhould not need to prove, if it lay directly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me; it being a matter of univerſal acknowledgment. I ſhall only ſay, that whereas there is on many accounts an immediate impreſs of Divine Authority on Parental reproofs, that which Children ought to conſider and know for themſelves is, that a <hi>continuance in the neglect, or contempt of them, is a token that ſeldom fails of approaching temporal and eternal Deſtruction,</hi> Prov. 30.17.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Authoritative reproof is <hi>Deſpotical;</hi> namely that of Governors, Rulers, and Maſters of Families. This alſo partakes of the Nature of thoſe foregoing, and being a Duty founded in the Law of Nature, as well as enforced by poſitive Divine commands, caſts a peculiar obligation to obedience on them that are ſo reproved. And where <hi>Servants</hi> regard not ſober and Chriſtian reproofs, as the Ordinance of God for their good, they loſe the advantages of their condition, and may be looked upon as unſanctified Sufferers in a ſtate of <hi>Bondage,</hi> which hath an eſpecial Character of the firſt curſe upon it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Reproof is <hi>Fraternal,</hi> or ſuch as is mutual between the members of the ſame Church, by vertue of that eſpecial Relation wherein they ſtand, and the obligation thence ariſing unto mutual watchfulneſs over each other, with Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions, Exhortations and Reproofs. As this is peculiarly appointed by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.15. in confirmation of the Ordinance in the Church of the Jews to that purpoſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. and confirmed by many Precepts and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the New Teſtament, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.18. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, 13. <hi>Chap.</hi> 12.15, 16. So the neglect of it is that which hath loſt us, not only the benefit, but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo the very nature of Church Societies. Wherefore our improvement of Rebukes in this kind depends much on a due conſideration of that Duty and Love, from whence they do proceed: For this we are by the Royal Law of Charity obliged unto the belief of, where there is not open evidence unto the contrary. And whereas it may be thoſe things, for which we may be thus reproved, are not of the greateſt importance in themſelves, who that is wiſe will by the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of the reproof it ſelf contract the open guilt of contemning the Wiſdom, Love and Care of Chriſt in the Inſtitution of this Ordinance?</p>
            <p n="3">III. And Laſtly, Reproofs are <hi>Friendly</hi> or occaſional, ſuch as may be Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred and managed by any Perſons, as Reaſons and Opportunities require, from the common Principle of univerſal Love unto mankind, eſpecially towards them that are of the Houſhold of Faith. Theſe alſo having in them the entire Nature of <hi>Reproofs,</hi> will fall under all the enſuing Directions, which have a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral reſpect thereunto.</p>
            <p>If then we would duely make uſe of, and Improve unto our Advantage the <hi>Reproofs</hi> that may be given us, we are ſeriouſly to conſider the nature of them, with reſpect unto thoſe by whom they are managed, for all the things we have mentioned are ſuited to influence our minds unto a regard of them, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The <hi>matter</hi> of a Reproof is duely to be weighed by him who deſigns any benefit thereby. And the firſt conſideration of it is: whether it be <hi>true,</hi> or <hi>falſe.</hi>
               <pb n="692" facs="tcp:95740:362"/> I ſhall not carry them unto more minute Diſtribution, of the Subſtance and Circumſtances of the matter intended, of the Whole, or Part of it; but do ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that from ſome Principal conſideration of it, every Reproof, as to its <hi>matter,</hi> may be denominated, and eſteemed true or falſe. And here our own conſciences with due Application unto the Rule are the proper Judge and Umpire. Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, if any way enlightned from the Word, will give an impartial ſentence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Guilt or Innocence of the Perſon, with reſpect unto the <hi>matter</hi> of a reproof. And there can be no more infallible evidence of a miſcarriage in ſuch a condition, than <hi>when Pride, or Paſſion, or Prejudice, or any corrupt Affection, can either out-brave, or ſtifle that compliance with a juſt reproof, which Conſcience will aſſuredly tender.</hi> Rom. 2.14.</p>
            <p>If a Reproof, as to the matter of it, be <hi>falſe,</hi> or unjuſt, and ſo judged in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed Conſcience, it may be conſidered in matter of Right, and of Fact. In the firſt caſe the matter may be true, and yet the reproof formally falſe and evil. In the latter the matter may be falſe, and yet the reproof an acceptable duty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A Reproof is falſe in matter of right, or formally, when we are reproved for that as evil, which is indeed our duty to perform. So <hi>David</hi> was fiercely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by his Brother <hi>Eliab</hi> for coming unto the Battel againſt the <hi>Philiſtines,</hi> aſcribing it to his Pride and the Naughtineſs of his Heart: whereunto he only replied, <hi>What have I done? Is there not a Cauſe?</hi> 1 Sam. 17.28, 29. And <hi>Peter</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf for declaring the Doctrine of the Croſs, <hi>Mark</hi> 8.33. And ſo we may be reproved for the Principal Duties that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of us. And if men were as free in reproving, as they are in reproaching, we ſhould not eſcape from daily rebukes for whatever we do in the worſhip of God. Now though ſuch reproofs generally may be looked on as <hi>Temptations,</hi> and ſo to be immediately rejected, as they were in the caſes inſtanced in; yet may they ſometimes, where they proceed from Love, and are managed with moderation, be conſidered as <hi>neceſſary cautions</hi> to look heedfully unto the Grounds and Reaſons we proceed upon in the Duties oppoſed, at which others do take offence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If the Reproof be falſe in matter of Fact, wherein that is charged on us, and reproved in us, whereof we are no ways guilty, three things are to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that it may not be unuſeful unto us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Circumſtances of the Reprover; as (1) Whether he do proceed on ſome probable miſtake; or (2) Credulity and eaſineſs in taking up reports; or (3) On evil, groundleſs ſurmiſes of his own; or (4) From a real godly jealou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, which hath been impoſed on, as eaſily it will be, by ſome appearances of Truth. Without a due Conſideration of theſe things we ſhall never know how to carry it aright towards them, by whom we are reproved for that whereof we are not guilty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider aright the difference between a <hi>Reproof,</hi> and a <hi>Reproach:</hi> for they may be both falſe alike, and that whereof we are reproved, have no more truth in it, than that wherewith we are reproached. Yea, we may be honeſtly repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for that which is falſe, and wickedly reproached with that which is true; ſo <hi>Auguſtin</hi> calls the Language of the Maid unto his Mother about drinking of
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:95740:362"/> Wine, <hi>durum convitium,</hi> though the matter of it were true enough. But a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach is the Acting of a mind deſigning of, and rejoycing in evil. Unto a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof it is eſſential that it ſpring from Love. <hi>Whom I love I rebuke,</hi> is the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Rule of theſe things. Let a man rebuke another, though for that which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is falſe, if it be in Love, it is a Reproof; but let him rebuke another, though for that which is True, if it be from a mind delighting in evil, it is a <hi>Reproach,</hi> and if it be <hi>falſe,</hi> it is moreover a Calumny.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Where a man in ſuch caſes is fully juſtified by the Teſtimony of his own Conſcience, bearing Witneſs unto his Integrity and Innocency, yet may he great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly miſcarry under the occaſion, if he attend not diligently unto his own Spirit, which moſt men judge to be ſet at the utmoſt liberty under ſuch injurious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocations as they eſteem them. Wherefore to keep our minds unto Sedate, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian moderation in ſuch caſes, and that we may not loſe the Advantage of what is befallen us, we ought immediately to apply them unto ſuch other Duties as the preſent Occaſion doth require: As,</p>
            <p n="1">1. To Search our own Hearts and ways, whether we have not indeed upon us the guilt of ſome greater evils, than that which is falſely charged on us, or for which we are reproved on miſtake. And if it appear ſo upon examination, we ſhall quickly ſee what little reaſon we have to tumultuate, &amp; riſe up with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation againſt the charge we ſuffer under. And may we not thence ſee much of the Wiſdom and goodneſs of God, who ſuffereth us to be exerciſed with what we can bear off with the impenetrable Shield of a good Conſcience, whilſt he graciouſly hides and covers thoſe greater evils of our hearts, with reſpect whereunto we cannot but condemn our ſelves?</p>
            <p n="2">2. To conſider that it is not of our ſelves that we are not guilty of the evil ſuſpected and charged. No man of ſobriety can on any miſtake reprove us for any thing, be it never ſo falſe, but that it is merely of ſoveraign Grace that we have not indeed contracted the guilt of it. And humble thankfulneſs unto God on this occaſion for his real preſerving Grace will abate the edge and take off the fierceneſs of our indignation againſt men for their ſuppoſed injurious deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with us.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Such Reproofs, if there be not open malice and continued wickedneſs manifeſt in them, are to be looked on as gracious <hi>Providential warnings,</hi> to take heed leſt at any time we ſhould be truely overtaken with that which at preſent we are falſely charged withal. We little know the Dangers that continually attend us, the Temptations wherewith we may be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized at unawares, nor how near on their account we may be unto any ſin or evil, which we judge our ſelves moſt remote from, and leaſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious unto. Neither on the other hand can we readily underſtand the wayes and meanes whereby the Holy Wiſe God iſſueth forth thoſe hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den proviſions of preventing Grace, which are continually adminiſtred for our Preſervation. And no wiſe man, who underſtands any thing of the deceitfulneſs of his own heart, with the numberleſs Numbers of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible
<pb n="694" facs="tcp:95740:363"/> occaſions of ſin, wherewith he is encompaſſed continually, but will readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly embrace ſuch Reproofs as Providential warnings unto watchfulneſs in thoſe things whereof before he was not aware.</p>
            <p n="4">4. When the mind by theſe Conſiderations is rendred Sedate and weighed unto Chriſtian moderation, then ought a man in ſuch caſes patiently and peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to undertake the Defence of his Innocency, and his own Vindication. And herein alſo there is need of much Wiſdom and Circumſpection; it being a matter of no ſmall difficulty for a man duely to manage ſelf, and Innocency, both which are apt to influence us unto ſome more than Ordinary vehemency of Spirit.</p>
            <p>But the Directions which might, and indeed ought to be given under all theſe particular Heads, would by no means be confined unto the Limits fixed to this Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If the matter of the Reproof be <hi>True</hi> in fact, then it is duely to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, whether the offence, for which any one is reproved, be <hi>Private,</hi> or <hi>Publick</hi> attended with ſcandal.</p>
            <p>If it be private, then it is to be weighed, whether it was known unto, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in and by the <hi>Perſon himſelf</hi> reproved, or no, before he was ſo reproved. If it were not ſo known, as we may juſtly be reproved for many things, which through Ignorance, or Inadvertency, or Compliance with the Cuſtoms of the World, we may have taken no notice of; and if the reproof bring along light and conviction with it, the firſt eſpecial improvement of ſuch a peculiar re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof is thankfulneſs to God for it, as a means of deliverance from any way, or work, or path that was unacceptable in his ſight. And hence a great Proſpect may be taken of the following deportment of the mind under other Reproofs. For a readineſs to take in Light and Conviction with reſpect unto any evil, that we are ignorant of, is an evidence of a readineſs to ſubmit to the Authority of God in any other Rebukes that have their Convictions going before them; ſo the heart that is prone to fortifie it ſelf by any Pleas or <hi>Pretences againſt convictions of ſin, in what it doth not yet own ſo to be, will be as prone unto obſtinacy under Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs in what it cannot but acknowledge to be evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If it were known before to the perſon reproved, but not ſuppoſed by him to be obſerved by others, under the covert of which imagination ſin often Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanceth it ſelf, that Soul will never make a due improvement of a <hi>Reproof,</hi> who is not firſt ſenſible of the Care and kindneſs of God in driving him from that retreat and hold, where the Intereſt of ſin had placed its chiefeſt Reſerve.</p>
            <p>Sins, ſo far Publick as to give matter of offence or ſcandal, are the ordinary Subject of all orderly Reproofs, and therefore need not in particular to be ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken unto.</p>
            <p>Having ſhewed the <hi>Nature</hi> of Reproofs in general, with ſuch conſiderations of the <hi>matter</hi> of them, as have afforded occaſion unto ſundry particular Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions relating unto the duty under Diſcuſſion, it remains only that we farther explain and confirm the two generals compriſed in the obſervation deduced from the Text; namely, (1) Why <hi>we ought to receive reproofs orderly, or regularly given unto us,</hi> eſteeming of them as a ſingular priviledge? and (2) <hi>How we may duely improve them</hi> unto their proper end, the Glory of God, and the Spiritual Advantage of our own Souls? As to the firſt of theſe we may obſerve,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="695" facs="tcp:95740:363"/>1. That mutual reproofs for the curing of evil, and preventing of danger in one another, are <hi>Prime Dictates</hi> of the Law of Nature, and that Obligation, which our Participation in the ſame Being, Offſpring, Original and End, to ſeek the good of each other, doth lay upon us. This God deſigned in our Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and this the rational Conſtitution of our Natures directs us unto. To ſeek and endeavour for each other all that good, whereof we are capable in Time, or unto Eternity, was indelibly implanted upon our Natures, and indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary unto that Society among our ſelves, with the great end of our joynt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto God, for which we were made. All the mutual evils of mankind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Perſons, or of Nations, deſigned or perpetrated againſt one another, are effects of our fatal Prevarication from the Law of our Creation. Hence <hi>Cain,</hi> the firſt open violent tranſgreſſor of the Rules and bounds of Humane Society, thought to juſtifie or excuſe himſelf by a Renunciation of that Principle, which God in Nature had made the Foundation of a Political or Sociable life with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto Temporal and Eternal ends; <hi>Am I,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>my Brother's keeper?</hi> Gen. 4. Yea, God had made every man the keeper of his Brother ſo far, as that they ſhould in all things in their opportunities, and unto their Power, ſeek their good, and Deliverance from Evil. In thoſe things which are good unto us, thoſe which are Spiritual and Eternal have the Preeminence. Theſe nothing can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice but Sin and Mortal evils, whoſe prevention therefore in one another, ſo far as we are able, is a Duty of the Law of Nature, and the prime effect of that Love which we owe unto the whole <hi>Offſpring of that one Blood,</hi> whereof God hath made all Nations. And one of the moſt effectual means for that end are the reproofs whereof we treat. And the Obligation is the ſame on thoſe that give them, and thoſe to whom they are given, with reſpect unto their ſeveral Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts in this Duty. Wherefore to neglect, to deſpiſe, not thankfully to receive ſuch reproofs, as are juſtly and regularly given unto us at any time, is to contemn the Law of our Creation, and to trample on the prime effect of Fraternal Love. Yea, to deſpiſe <hi>Reproofs</hi> and to Diſcountenance the diſcharge of that Duty, is to open a Door unto that mutual hatred and diſlike, which in the ſight of God is Murder. See <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.17. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.15. Let us therefore look to our ſelves, for there is no greater ſign of a degeneracy from the Law, and all the ends of our Creation, than an unwillingneſs to receive reproofs juſtly deſerved and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly adminiſtred; or not to eſteem of them, as a bleſſed effect of the Wiſdom and goodneſs of God towards us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Whereas the light of Nature is variouſly obſcured, and its directive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er debilitated in us, God hath renewed on us an Obligation unto this Duty by particular Inſtitutions both under the Old Teſtament and the New. The Truth is, the efficacy of the Law of Creation, as unto Moral Duties, being exceedingly impaired by the entrance of ſin; and the exerciſe of Original native love towards mankind being impeded and obſtructed by that confuſion and diſorder, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>into the whole ſtate of mankind was caſt by ſin, every one thereby being made the enemy of another, as the Apoſtle declares, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.3. not being cured by that coaleſcency into evil Societies which reſpects only <hi>Political,</hi> and Temporal ends, the diſcharge of this Duty was utterly loſt, at leaſt beyond that which was merely <hi>Parental.</hi> Wherefore God in the Inſtitution of his Church, both under the Old Teſtament and the New, did mould men into ſuch Peculiar Societies
<pb n="696" facs="tcp:95740:364"/> and Relations, as wherein way might be made meet again for the exerciſe thereof. He hath ſo diſpoſed of us, that every one may know every one whom he is obliged to reprove, and every one may know every one whom he is obliged to hear. And as he hath hereby cured that confuſion we were caſt into, which was obſtructive of the exerciſe of this Duty; ſo by the Renovation of poſitive commands, attended with Inſtructions, Directions, Promiſes and Threatnings, enforcing the giving and receiving of Reproofs, with reſpect unto Moral and Spiritual ends, he hath relieved us againſt that obſcurity of Natural light which we before laboured under. Should I go to expreſs the Commands, Directions, Exhortations, Promiſes and Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, which are given in the Scripture to this purpoſe, it would be a work as endleſs, as I ſuppoſe it needleſs to all that are converſant in the Holy Writings. It may ſuffice unto our preſent purpoſe, that, there being an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs inſtitution of God for the giving and taking of <hi>Reproofs,</hi> and that an effect of infinite Goodneſs, Benignity and Love towards us; not thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to receive Reproofs, when it is our Lot to deſerve them, and to have them, is to deſpiſe the Authority of God over us, and his gracious Care for us. When therefore it befalleth any to be juſtly and orderly reproved, let him call to mind the Authority and love of God therein, which will quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly give him that ſenſe of their worth and excellency, as will make him thankful for them; which is the firſt ſtep unto their due Improvement.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A due conſideration of the uſe, benefit and advantage of them, will give them a ready admiſſion into our minds and affections. Who knows how many Souls, that are now at reſt with God, have been prevented by Reproofs, as the outward means, from going down into the Pit? Unto how many have they been an occaſion of converſion and ſincere turning un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God? How many have been recovered by them from a ſtate of backſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and awakened from a ſecure ſleep in ſin? How many great and bloody ſins hath the perpetration of been obviated by them? How many ſnares of Temptations have they been the means to break and cancel? What revivings have they been to grace, what diſappointments unto the ſnares of Satan, who can declare? The Advantage, which the Souls of men do or might receive every day by them, is more to be valued than all earthly Treaſures whatever: And ſhall any of us, when it comes to be our concern, through a predominancy of Pride, paſſion and prejudice, or through curſed Sloth and Security, the uſual means of the defeatment of theſe advantages, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt our ſelves to have no intereſt in, or valuation of theſe things, by an unreadineſs or unwillingneſs to receive <hi>Reproofs,</hi> when tendered unto us in the way, and according to the mind of God?</p>
            <p>But now ſuppoſe we are willing to receive them, it will be enquired in the laſt place, what Conſiderations may further us in their due Improvement? and what Directions may be given thereunto? An Anſwer to this enquiry ſhall ſhut up this Diſcourſe. And I ſhall ſay hereunto,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If there be not open evidence unto the contrary, it is our Duty to judge that every <hi>Reproof</hi> is given us in a way of Duty. This will take
<pb n="697" facs="tcp:95740:364"/> off offence with reſpect unto the Reprover, which unjuſtly taken is an aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured entrance into a way of loſing all benefit and advantage by the Reproof. The reaſon why any man doth regularly reprove another, is becauſe God requireth him ſo to do, and by his command hath made it his Duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him that is reproved. And do we judge it reaſonable that one ſhould neglect their Duty towards God and us, and in ſome degree or other make himſelf guilty of our ſins, for no other cauſe, but leſt we ſhould be diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that we are not ſuffered to ſin ſecurely, and it may be to periſh eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And if we are convinced that it is the Duty of another to Reprove us, we cannot but be convinced that it is our Duty to hearken and attend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto. And this will fix the mind unto a due conſideration of the preſent Duty that lyes before us, and what is our juſt concernment in the <hi>Reproof.</hi> Beſides if it be done in a way of Duty, it is done in Love; for all orderly rebukes are effects of Love. And if we are convinced of any one, that he doth reprove in a way of Duty, we muſt be ſatisfied that what he doth proceedeth from Love, without by-ends or Diſſimulation. For what doth not ſo, be it what it will, belongs not to rebuking in a way of Duty. And this will remove all obſtructing prejudices in all who have the leaſt gracious ingenuity. <hi>Ahab</hi> deſpiſed the warning of <hi>Micaiah,</hi> becauſe he thought they mutually hated one another; he knew how it was with himſelf, and falſly ſo judged of the Prophet by his neceſſary ſharpneſs towards him. But where there are ſuch ſurmiſes, all advantages of reproofs will be aſſuredly loſt. Where therefore our minds are ſatisfied that any reproof is an effect of Love, and given in a way of Duty, <hi>Dimidium facti,</hi> we are half way in the diſcharge of the Duty directed unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Take heed of cheriſhing habitually ſuch diſorders, vices and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers of mind, as are contrary unto this Duty, and will fruſtrate the deſign of it. Such are (1) Haſtineſs of Spirit. Some mens minds do with ſuch fury apply themſelves unto their firſt apprehenſion of things, that they caſt the whole Soul into diſorder, and render it uncapable of further ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional conſiderations. There may be, it is poſſible, ſome failures and miſtakes in uſeful and neceſſary Reproofs, in matter, manner, circumſtance, ſome way, or other. This immediately is ſeized on by men of <hi>haſty Spirits</hi> (a Vice and Folly ſufficiently condemned in Scripture,) turned unto a Provocation, made a matter of ſtrife and diſpute, until the whole advantage of the Reproof is utterly loſt and vaniſheth. A Quiet, Gentle, Conſiderative, Sedate frame of Spirit is required unto this Duty. (2) Pride, and Haughtineſs of mind, Self-conceit, Elation of Spirit, which will be inſeparably accompanied with the contempt of others, and a ſcorn that any ſhould think themſelves either ſo much wiſer, or ſo much better than our ſelves, as to reprove us in any kind, are a fenced Wall againſt any benefit, or advantage by Reproofs; yea, things that will turn Judgment into Hemlock, and the moſt ſoveraign Antidote into Poyſon. No wild Beaſt in a toyl doth more rave and tear and rend, than a Proud man, when he is reproved. And therefore he who manifeſts himſelf ſo to be, hath ſecured himſelf from being any more troubled by
<pb n="698" facs="tcp:95740:365"/> ſerious reproofs from any wiſe man whatever. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 9.7, 8. (3) Prejudices; which are ſo variouſly occaſioned, as it were endleſs to recount. If now we make it not our conſtant buſineſs to purge our minds from theſe depraved Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, they will never fail effectually to exert themſelves on all occaſions to the utter defeatment of all uſe in, or benefit by the moſt neceſſary and regular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Reckon aſſuredly, that a fault, a miſcarriage, which any one is duely repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for, if the reproof be not received, and improved as it ought, is not only aggravated, but accumulated with a new crime, and marked with a dangerous Token of an incurable Evil. See <hi>Prov.</hi> 29.1. Let men do what they can, bear themſelves high in their expreſſions, grow angry, paſſionate, excuſe or palliate, unleſs they are ſeared, and profligately obſtinate, their own Conſciences will take part with a juſt and regular Reproof. If hereupon they come not up to amendment, their guilt is encreaſed by the occaſional excitation of the Light of Conſcience to give it an eſpecial charge, and there is an additional ſin in the contempt of the Reproof it ſelf. But that which principally ſhould make men careful, and even tremble in this caſe is, that they are put on a Trial whether ever they will forſake the evil of their ways and doings or no: For he who is orderly reproved for any fault, and neglects or deſpiſeth the <hi>Rebuke,</hi> can have no aſſurance that he ſhall ever be delivered from the evil rebuked; but hath juſt cauſe to fear that he is entering into a courſe of hardneſs and impenitency.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is uſeful unto the ſame end immediately to compare the Reproof with the Word of Truth. This is the meaſure, ſtandard and directory of all Duties, whereunto in all dubious caſes we ſhould immediately retreat for advice and counſel. And whereas there are two things conſiderable in a Reproof; Firſt, the matter of it, that it be true, and a juſt cauſe or reaſon of a rebuke; and Secondly, the right which the Reprover hath unto this Duty, with the Rule which he walked by therein; if both theſe for the ſubſtance of them prove to be juſtified by the Scripture, then have we in ſuch a caſe no more to do with the Reprover, nor any of his circumſtances, but immediately and directly with God himſelf: for where he gives expreſs warranty and direction for a Duty in his Word, his own Authority is as directly exerted thereby, as if he ſpoke unto us from Heaven. Hereby will the mind be prevented from many wandrings and vain reliefs, which fooliſh imagination will ſuggeſt, and be bound up unto its preſent Duty. Let our unwillingneſs to be reproved be what it will, as alſo our prejudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces againſt our Reprover, if we are not at leaſt free to bring the Conſideration and Examination of the one and the other unto the Word of Truth, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our deeds are evil, and therefore we love Darkneſs more than Light. No milder, nor more gentle cenſure can be paſſed on any, who is not free to bring any Reproof that may be given him unto an impartial Tryal by the Word, whether it be according to the mind of God, or no. If this be done, and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of its Truth and neceſſity do then appear; then let the Soul know it hath to do with God himſelf, and wiſely conſider what anſwer he will return, what ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count he will give unto him. Wherefore</p>
            <p n="5">5. The beſt way to keep our Souls in a readineſs rightly to receive and duely to improve ſuch Reproofs as may regularly be given us by any, is to keep and preſerve our Souls and Spirits in a conſtant awe and reverence of the Reproofs
<pb n="699" facs="tcp:95740:365"/> of God which are recorded in his Word. The neglect, or contempt of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proofs is that which the generality of mankind do ſplit themſelves upon, and periſh eternally. This is ſo fully and Graphically expreſſed, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. that nothing can be added thereunto. And the great means, whereby much hardneſs comes upon others through the deceitfulneſs of ſin, is want of keeping up a due ſenſe or reverence of Divine Reproofs and Threatnings on their Souls.

David</hi> had ventured to tranſgreſs, and that very hainouſly: and in his break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God's Law, he had broken his own peace; in his diſhonouring of God's Name, he had wounded his own Conſcience. After his ſin, <hi>David</hi> is ſhy of God, and keeps ſilence for a while, maketh no confeſſion; God is highly offended, and hides his face from him, but layeth his hand ſorely upon him, making ſuch a deep impreſſion of his diſpleaſure upon his Spirit, that he ſunk under the weight of it; and it became ſo very grievous unto him, that he roareth out all the day under the horrible anguiſh which he felt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by; yea, he complaineth that his moiſture was hereby turned into the drought of Summer. In this condition <hi>David</hi> could find no relief, no eaſe, or aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwagement of his grief, until upon acknowledgement of his Sin he had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained forgiveneſs, and God through his free grace, and tender mercy, had covered his iniquity, as we ſhall find in the 3, 4, and 5. verſes of this <hi>Pſalm;</hi> which I take to be the occaſion of the joyful acclamation, and ſweet expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in my Text, the firſt verſe of the <hi>Pſalm,</hi> concerning the bleſſedneſs of remiſſion, or happineſs of the man that hath, with him, obtained ſo great a priviledg; which priviledg none have a greater ſight of, than thoſe that have felt the wounds and ſmart, and roared under the horrour of an accuſing Conſcience, and been terrified with the furious rebukes of God's angry Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance.

David</hi> wrote theſe words not from himſelf, but as he was inſpired by the Holy Ghoſt; and if any ſaying in the whole Book of the Scriptures be the Word of God, (as all of them are) this is his Word, and this is his Sentence, which is confirmed in the New Teſtament,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.7.</note> the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> quoting theſe very vvords to prove the Doctrine of juſtification by Faith vvithout vvorks; God pronounceth ſuch to be Bleſſed vvhoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and therefore they muſt needs be Bleſſed, becauſe God ſpeaketh of things as they are; never did a lye, falſhood, or miſtake proceed out of his Mouth. God, vvho alone giveth the Bleſſing, pronounceth pardoned Perſons Bleſſed, and therefore they are Bleſſed. When <hi>Iſaac</hi> gave his Fatherly Bleſſing unto <hi>Jacob,</hi> though it vvere upon a miſtake, he ſuppoſing him to have been <hi>Eſau</hi> his firſt-born Son; yet afterward did not, he vvould not retract it, but telleth <hi>Eſau,</hi> vvho too late ſought for it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 27.33. <hi>I have Bleſſed him, and he ſhall be Bleſſed.</hi> Surely then, vvhere God, vvho never miſtaketh, doth pronounce the Bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any, he doth not, he vvill not retract it, but they are Bleſſed, and ſhall be Bleſſed.</p>

Pardoned perſons are delivered from the greateſt evil, and that is ſin, vvhich is the greateſt evil in it ſelf, becauſe moſt oppoſite to the chiefeſt good, and foraſmuch as it is the cauſe of all other evils, that either do or can befal mankind.

Such whoſe iniquities are forgiven, are delivered from the guilt of ſin, they are free from Obligation to puniſhment, and ſo are no longer expoſed thereunto: through Chriſt they have remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, being by Faith intereſted in his merit and ſatisfaction; and God's juſtice cannot require the ſatisfaction again of them, which he hath already received of Chriſt, and accepted for them. Chriſt is their ſurety, who hath payed their Debts, in forgiveneſs they are diſcharged, and God will not require the Debt any more of them. Therefore there is no Condemnation to them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. Jeſus having delivered them from the wrath to come, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 1.8. It is ſin alſo which can alone deprive any of eternal happineſs; In the firſt Covenant God promiſed life and everlaſting felicity upon the condition of perfect obedience; it is only diſobedience which doth hinder the fulfilling of this promiſe. It was ſin which threw man at the firſt out of Paradiſe, and which ſtill doth keep men out of Heaven; nothing doth hinder men's happineſs here, nothing can deprive them of happineſs in the other world, but this evil of evils, Sin; hence then it will undeniably follow, that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned Perſons, who are delivered from ſin, muſt needs be Bleſſed, there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing which can procure their miſery or prevent their Bleſſedneſs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the forgiveneſs of ſin their ſin is removed with the evil conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and effects thereof. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.12. <hi>As far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt, ſo far hath he removed our tranſgreſſions from us.</hi>

Where ever God fulfils the one promiſe, he doth fulfil the other too. God forgiveth iniquity to none, but at the ſame time he becometh their God, and brings them into the Bleſſed relation of his Covenant-people. <hi>They are Bleſſed that have the Lord for their God.</hi> Pſal. 144.15. <hi>Happy is that People that is in ſuch a caſe, yea, happy is that People wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

They are taken into God's favour. 2. They are taken into God's family. 3. They are under God's provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. 4. They have free acceſs unto God in Prayer. 5. They have Communion with God in all his Ordinances; and thus it is with all pardoned Perſons, and therefore they are Bleſſed.</p>

               <pb n="704" facs="tcp:95740:368"/>1. Pardoned Perſons being taken into Covenant are taken into God's fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour. Nothing doth hinder God's ſpecial favour but unpardoned ſin, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but that which is the only Object of his hatred, and cauſe of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure; and this is nothing elſe but ſin. Although God's love have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Objects, yet his hatred hath but one, and that is ſin; God hateth none of his Creatures, as they are Creatures, but as they are ſinful; never did any thing offend or diſpleaſe God but ſin; nothing elſe hath power to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindle God's anger, and to blow it up into a flame. When God forgiveth ſin, his hatred ceaſeth, his anger is removed, and he receiveth them whom he pardoneth into the arms of his ſpecial love. God's favour is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar priviledg of God's pardoned People. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 106.4. <hi>Remember me with the favour which thou beareſt to thy People: O, viſit me with thy Salvation.</hi> Therefore all pardoned Perſons being in God's favour, they are Bleſſed; becauſe his favour is the Fountain of Bleſſedneſs: <hi>In his favour there is life,</hi> Pſal. 30.5. <hi>Yea, his loving kindneſs is better than life,</hi> Pſal. 63.3. The favour of an earthly King is counted a great Priviledg, but the favour of the King of Heaven is really a great Bleſſedneſs. The God of Heaven who is ſo Powerful, Wiſe, Faithful, Good, Merciful, hath a ſpecial fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and kindneſs for them, and doth love them with an incomparable, incomprehenſible, unchangeable, and eternal Love, therefore they muſt needs be the happieſt People on the Earth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pardoned Perſons being in Covenant are taken into God's family; being reconciled by the Croſs of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.16. they are no more <hi>ſtrangers and forreigners, but fellow-Citizens with the Saints, and of the Houſhold of God,</hi> v. 19.

If beggars were lifted up from the Dunghil, to be adopted Children of the greateſt Prince upon the Earth, it would not be ſo great an honour to them, as this honour and dignity which is conferred upon pardoned Perſons, in their being advanced into the number of the adopted Children of the great <hi>Jehovah,</hi> the Lord of Heaven and Earth; and will any queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are Bleſſed?</p>

            <p n="4">4. Pardoned Perſons being in Covenant have free acceſs unto God in Prayer: <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.18. <hi>Through him we have acceſs by one Spirit unto the Father.</hi> Chap. 3.12. <hi>In whom we have boldneſs and acceſs with confidence by the Faith of him.</hi> Heb. 4.16. <hi>Let us therefore come boldly to the Throne of Grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find Grace to help in time of need.</hi> Being pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and reconciled through Chriſt, they may with boldneſs and confidence come daily to the Throne of Grace, and there by Prayer and Supplication make known their requeſts unto God, and they ſhall be ſure to have both acceptance and audience. God who hath given them a pardon, will deny them nothing that is really for their good; having intereſt in Chriſt, who hath ſuch intereſt in Heaven, whatever they ask of the Father in his Name, if it is according to his will, they may be aſſured, becauſe Chriſt hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully promiſed it, that he will do it for them. Surely then ſuch Perſons are happy.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Pardoned Perſons being in Covenant have Communion with God in all his Ordinances, not only in Prayer, but hearing of the Word, Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and at the Table of the Lord; when others reſt in the out-ſide of Ordinances, they meet with God there; Sin being removed, which before made a ſeparation, they now attain Communion with God, and their hearts cloſe with him as their chief good. There is nothing more ſweet in the World than Communion with God; hence <hi>David</hi> doth account thoſe moſt happy that had the liberty of God's Houſe, and Ordinances, where they did or might enjoy ſo great a priviledg. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84.4. <hi>Bleſſed are they that dwell in thy Houſe.</hi> And <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65.4. <hi>Bleſſed is the man whom thou chooſeſt and cauſeſt to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy Courts; he ſhall be ſatisfied with the goodneſs of thy Houſe,
<pb n="706" facs="tcp:95740:369"/> even of thy Holy Temple.</hi> Such only are truely Bleſſed that find ſatisfaction; it is not the Enjoyment of Creatures will give this; but in the Enjoyment of and Communion with God in his Ordinances, which is the goodneſs of God's Houſe, true ſatisfaction may be found; and therefore pardoned Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, who do attain this, are truely and the only Bleſſed Perſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 4. Such muſt needs be Bleſſed whoſe iniquities are forgiven, becauſe they are in a better ſtate than <hi>Adam</hi> was in his firſt Creation. None will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who read and believe the Scriptures, that <hi>Adam</hi> was Bleſſed before he ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; there was no Curſe of the Law upon man, until the Law was broken by him; and as God made all other things good, ſo man as he came out of God's hand was made both Good and Happy.</p>
            <p>The primitive Bleſſedneſs of <hi>Adam</hi> conſiſted chiefly in two things.</p>
            <p>Firſt, In the Innocency which was in him. Secondly, In the Image of God which was upon him; whereby he was capacitated for, and had a near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Communion and fellowſhip with God. In both reſpects pardoned Perſons are in a better eſtate than <hi>Adam.</hi> 1. In reſpect of Innocency, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they cannot ſo properly be called Innocent in themſelves, doubtleſs they are not ſo Innocent as <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall; yet upon their pardon they are guiltleſs, they are reputed Innocent in the ſight of God, and (however God may chaſtiſe them for ſin here) they ſhall no more be puniſhed for any ſin in the other World, than if they had never offended, than if they had never committed any the leaſt ſin from their Birth unto their Death, but had been as white and clean, as pure and Innocent as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> before his fall, or the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> who never fell: and herein their condition is better than that of <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocency, becauſe no guilt ſhall be charged upon them unto their Condemnation; whereas <hi>Adam</hi> had no ſuch ſecurity againſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation; for afterward he falling into ſin, would certainly have fallen into Hell, had not pardoning mercy prevented it. 2. In regard of the Image of God, that is repaired in all thoſe that are pardoned; when God forgiveth their ſin, he changeth their nature; and that Faith which juſtifieth the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, doth alſo purifie the heart. <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. Indeed pardoned Perſons are renewed but in part; and the inherent Righteouſneſs and Holineſs, which they attain unto in this life, is but imperfect; yet in this they are in a better condition than <hi>Adam</hi> was at firſt, becauſe, although <hi>Adam</hi>'s inherent Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs were perfect, yet it was left to his own keeping, and he quickly loſt it, and fell quite off from God, putting himſelf out of God's favour and out of Covenant together, and there was no Salvation attainable by him, until God had promiſed Chriſt, and made a New Covenant of Grace with him: But the inherent Righteouſneſs of pardoned Perſons, although it be far ſhort, many degrees, of abſolute perfection, yet it is committed to the keeping of Chriſt by the Spirit in them, who is both able and hath promiſed to bring it unto perfection; ſo that they ſhall never totally fall from Grace, but grow up from one degree of Grace unto another, until they arrive unto Heaven, where they ſhall be abſolutely perfect both in Holineſs and happineſs; and in the mean time they are accepted as compleat and perfect in their head, the
<pb n="707" facs="tcp:95740:369"/> 
               <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> whoſe perfect Righteouſneſs is through Faith imputed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, whereby the defects of their righteouſneſs are ſupplyed, and they adopted to eternal Life. Pardoned perſons are in a better ſtate than <hi>Adam,</hi> therefore they are bleſſed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reaſ.</hi> 5. Such whoſe iniquities are forgiven are bleſſed becauſe they ſhall be bleſſed; the bleſſedneſs of pardoned perſons is chiefly in hope of future bleſſedneſs, without which hope in ſome circumſtance of time, they would be, as the Apoſtle ſaith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19. <hi>of all Men moſt miſerable;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſhall chiefly ſpeak of the future bleſſedneſs of the pardoned; and here 1. Shew what the future bleſſedneſs is which pardoned perſons ſhall have. 2. Prove that pardoned perſons ſhall moſt aſſuredly attain this bleſſedneſs. 3. Shew how this future bleſſedneſs doth render them bleſſed at the preſent; and this will be a full proof that pardoned perſons are bleſſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt thing is to ſhew, what the future bleſſedneſs is which pardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſons ſhall have; and here I muſt premiſe that there is but little of this future bleſſedneſs revealed in compariſon of what it really is, and what par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned perſons will find it to be; Miniſters have preached and written much concerning it, but they have not told one half, no nor the thouſand part of the Glory and excellency thereof; and it muſt be but little then that I have time or room to ſpeak of it in this diſcourſe; yet ſomething I muſt ſay, and it is no difficult thing to ſet it forth by Scripture-light and in a few words, as far exceeding all outward happineſs, and earthly felicity. The bleſſedneſs which pardoned perſons ſhall have, doth lye in three things. 1. In the bleſſed and glorious place where they ſhall live. 2. In the bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious company which they ſhall converſe withal. 3. In the bleſſed and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſtate which they ſhall attain to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Pardoned perſons ſhall live and take up their eternal abode in a moſt bleſſed and glorious place; <hi>Here they have no continuing City, but they ſeek one to come,</hi> Heb. 13.14. The moſt ſtrong and flouriſhing Cities in the World may be demoliſhed by the hands of Men, or overthrown by Earthquakes, or conſumed and turned into aſhes by the devouring flames of fire; but the City they ſhall dwell in cannot be demoliſhed, overthrown, or conſumed; that City will abide and continue ſo long as God ſhall abide, the Maker of it; <hi>They look for a City which hath Foundations whoſe Builder and Maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11.10. The Foundations of this City are ſure and ſtrong, ſuch as ſhall never be moved; the Cities and Houſes they now dwell in are made by man, and therefore are but mean; but the City they ſhall dwell in is of God's Building and Making, and therefore is very glorious. It is the New <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> which they ſhall hereafter inhabit, the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above, the Walls and Gates thereof are Pearls, and the Streets thereof pure Gold, as it is deſcribed, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21. at the latter end of that Chapter: But the place is beyond all compariſon, and doth exceed in glory whatever deſcription may be made of it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Pardoned perſons ſhall have moſt bleſſed and glorious company to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe withal in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="708" facs="tcp:95740:370"/>1. In Heaven pardoned perſons vvill have the company of all the Saints, there they vvill find all their godly friends and acquaintance, and that both ſuch as die before them, and thoſe that die after them; in vvhoſe Society they vvill have a mutual ſweet complacency, and their joy one in another vvill exceed vvhat tongues can expreſs. There they ſhall have the company of all thoſe Godly Miniſters, either vvhom they have known and heard, or vvhoſe Writings only they have ſeen and read; and how vvill the ſpiritual children delight to ſee the glory, and live always in the company of their ſpiritual Fathers, vvhom God hath made inſtrumental for their converſion? then they vvill rejoyce indeed that ever they ſaw their face, that ever they heard their voice, that ever they believed their report, that ever they vvere per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by them to repent of their ſins, and accept of God's Son, to come into, and to keep in God's vvays, vvhen they ſee vvhither thoſe vvays have brought them. There they vvill meet vvith all the Holy Martyrs, ſo famous in their generations for their courage and conſtancy; vvith all the Holy <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets</hi> and <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> the Pen-men of the Scriptures, ſo famous in their time for the large and plentiful effuſion of the Spirit of God upon them; vvith all the good Kings and Princes, and all the righteous perſons vvhatever, that have lived in all ages and generations, of all kinreds, Nations, and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages; they ſhall then be gathered all into one body under Chriſt their head, and joyn together in bleſſing, and praiſing, and ſinging <hi>Hallelujah's</hi> unto the Lord for ever.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Heaven pardoned perſons will have the company of all the glorious Angels; here the Angels guard them, and are miniſtring Spirits unto them, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. Hereafter they will be their companions, and there will be mutual and moſt ſweet converſe between them. Some delight in the company of Nobles, and the great ones which belong to the Courts of great Princes; they ſhall have the company and converſation of the glorious Angels, who are the Nobles of Heaven, and Courtiers of the King of Kings. How the Angels and Saints will converſe together, and communicate their minds one to another, is too high for us to conceive, and too difficult for us to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; but ſurely the converſe will be very ſweet, and full of love and delight.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Heaven pardoned perſons will have the company and fellowſhip of the glorious Spirit, the Holy Ghoſt; here they have his preſence and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operations; they feel now, eſpecially at ſome times, his ſweet breathings and powerful operations, which do wonderfully enlighten them, greatly quicken and inflame their hearts with divine love, yea, and fill their hearts with ſpiritual and heavenly joy: But in Heaven they ſhall have a fuller, ſweeter, more powerful and conſtant preſence of the glorious Spirit; they ſhall there be filled with the Holy Ghoſt, as full as they can hold, yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond their preſent capacity; they ſhall be under the ſweet breathings of the Spirit, whereby the flame of divine love will be kept alive in them perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the greateſt height, and heat of it, and this ſhall abide to Eternity.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="709" facs="tcp:95740:370"/>4. In Heaven pardoned perſons ſhall have the company of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his glory. Here they have heard of him, there they ſhall ſee him; here they ſee him with the eye of Faith, there they ſhall ſee him eye to eye, and face to face. <hi>Auſtin</hi> did wiſh to have ſeen three things, above all other things that were to be ſeen in the World; <hi>Rome</hi> in its Glory, <hi>Paul</hi> in the Pulpit, and Chriſt in the fleſh; The righteous in Heaven will ſee that which is far beyond <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s wiſh, they will ſee <hi>Zion</hi> in its Glory, <hi>Paul</hi> in his Glory, and Chriſt in his Glory. They will ſee <hi>Zion</hi> in its glory, which will far ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>Rome</hi> in its greateſt ſplendour, when it was moſt illuſtrious for wealth and riches, through the ſpoyls of ſo many conquered Kingdoms which were brought into it, when it was moſt illuſtrious for ſtately houſes, and ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous buildings, for wiſe and learned Men, famous and valiant Captains and Souldiers. The new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> Mount <hi>Zion</hi> which is above, will out-ſhine <hi>Rome</hi> in glory, more than the Sun doth out-ſhine the ſmalleſt Star in Heaven, or the faint light of a Candle here upon earth. They ſhall ſee <hi>Paul</hi> in his glory, they ſhall hear him praiſing God with triumphant acclamations of joy, which will be far more than to hear him preach in a ſtate of weakneſs and infirmity; but chiefly they ſhall ſee Chriſt in his glory, the ſight of Chriſt in his humiliation was nothing in compariſon of a ſight of him in his ſtate of exaltation. They ſhall ſee him then as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Behold now are we the Sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we ſhall be; but we know that when he ſhall appear we ſhall be like him, for we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> Chriſt was never ſeen on earth as he is; his glory was ſhadowed, his Divinity was vailed, and his humanity was moſt evident to the view, which had its infirmities: but hereafter his humanity will appear to be lifted up into ſuch glory as doth exceed all created glory of Men or Angels, and his Divinity will be moſt illuſtrious to the view of the Saints, at the ſight of which they will be aſtoniſhed with admiration and love; and O how will they gaze and wonder at his marvellous beauty, and ſhining excellency, when they ſee him come down from Heaven attended by all the holy Angels, and when they ſhall not only ſee him, but meet with him, be owned and welcomed by him, and be taken to live with him! 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>The Lord himſelf ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch-angel, and with the Trump of God, and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt: Then we which are alive and remain, ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds to meet the Lord in the Air, and ſo ſhall we ever be with the Lord.</hi> It was a great privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg which the Apoſtles had to live with Chriſt when he was humbled and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified here on earth; what a priviledg then will it be which all the righteous ſhall have to live with Chriſt when he is glorified in Heaven, and that not for a few years, but for ever? What a happineſs will it be to ſee the glory which Chriſt had with the Father before the World was, and not only to ſee it, but to ſhare in it?</p>
            <p n="5">5. In Heaven pardoned perſons ſhall have the company of the Father; they have his gracious preſence here on earth, they ſhall have his glorious preſence in Heaven; there they ſhall have the immediate Beatifical viſion of him, and the full moſt bleſſed fruition of him. The ſight of God's back-parts, the glimpſes and glances of his eye at a diſtance, the mediate en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment
<pb n="710" facs="tcp:95740:371"/> of him in and by Ordinances doth ſometimes even tranſport them, and ſtrangely fill them with wonder and delight; but O what Soul-raviſhing admirations, what tranſports and extaſies of joy will they have, when in Heaven they ſhall behold God's face, be alwayes under the beams of the light of his countenance, and have continual, cloſe, intimate, full enjoyment of him, fellowſhip and communion with him, and this to abide for ever and ever! In Heaven they ſhall dwell with God, and God will dwell with them, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. <hi>I heard a great voice out of Heaven, ſaying, behold the Tabernacle of God is with Men, and he will dwell with them, and they ſhall be his people, and God himſelf ſhall be with them, and be their God.</hi> This, this will be happineſs indeed, to have God himſelf to dwell with them, and manifeſt himſelf not only in his grace, but in his glory unto them, therefore it follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>v.</hi> 4. <hi>And God ſhall wipe away all tears from their eyes;</hi> There will be no grief where God's preſence is, in his preſence there being fulneſs of joy, and pleaſures for evermore, <hi>and there ſhall be no more death, neither ſorrow, nor <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

                  </gap>ing, neither any more pain,</hi> the full ſight of God will cure of all pain and ſorrow, and fill with delight and joy, as <hi>Herbert</hi> in his Poem called, <hi>The Glance.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>
               <l>If thy firſt glance ſo powerful be,</l>
               <l>A mirth but opened, and ſeal'd up again;</l>
               <l>What wonders ſhall we feel, when we ſhall ſee</l>
               <l>Thy full eyed love.</l>
               <l>When thou ſhalt look us out of pain,</l>
               <l>And one aſpect of thine ſpend in delight,</l>
               <l>More than ten thouſand Suns diſperſe in light,</l>
               <l>In Heaven above.</l>
            </q>
            <p n="3">3. Pardoned perſons ſhall in Heaven attain a bleſſed and glorious ſtate; a ſtate of peace and tranquillity; a ſtate of wealth and plenty; a ſtate of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and dignity; a ſtate of holineſs and purity; a ſtate of perfect happineſs and glory, in Soul and Body.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Heaven pardoned perſons ſhall attain a ſtate of peace, of perfect peace and tranquillity: they ſhall have perfect peace without them, and they ſhall have perfect peace within them; here they have Wars about them, and rumours of Wars; and when they don't hear of Wars, except it be afar off, they have jarrs near at hand, and that every day; they ſee Men and Women fighting, wounding and murdering one another with the Sword of the Tongue, and many are the thruſts, vvhich they themſelves have received on every ſide; and howſoever deſirous they are of peace, and follow after it, yet they cannot attain it, but are forced to complain vvith <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 120.6, 7. <hi>My Soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace, I am for peace, but when I ſpeak, they are for War.</hi> But in Heaven they ſhall be hid for ever from the vvounds and ſcourge of the Tongue; Heaven is a Kingdom vvhere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in dwels righteouſneſs, and vvherein dwels peace. In Heaven they ſhall be freed from all ſtrife and contention, from all bitterneſs, clamour, and evil
<pb n="711" facs="tcp:95740:371"/> ſpeaking, no unpeaceable Spirit ſhall be admitted into the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and never ſhall any the leaſt quarrel ariſe between the Inhabitants of that place. And as they ſhall have perfect peace without them, ſo they ſhall have perfect peace within them. Here they are often wounding themſelves, and that more deeply and ſorely than any Man can do, I mean, they too often wound their conſciences by their ſins; and if peace be attained by them, through faith in Chriſt's blood, this peace is often interrupted and broken by them through their renewed provocations; and at the beſt their peace it is but imperfect in this life: But in Heaven they ſhall have perfect peace within, ſuch a calm and ſerenity, ſuch a quiet and tranquillity of Spirit, as ſhall never have the leaſt diſturbance any more. In the upper region of the Air there are no ſtorms or tempeſts, all that be are in the middle or lower region; and when they are exalted unto the higheſt Heavens, that region which is beyond the Stars, they ſhall be removed beyond all thoſe ſtorms of conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces within, and all thoſe tempeſts of troubles without, which are common and ordinary in the lower region of this World; there they ſhall have moſt ſweet reſt for their Souls for ever in the boſom of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Heaven pardoned Perſons ſhall attain a ſtate of wealth and plenty; however poor ſome of them are as to this World's riches, yet they ſhall be Rich, yea, they are Rich in Faith; the Riches which they have in hand, or heart rather, are great, but the Riches which they have in their eye or hope are far greater, their Grace is beyond the worldling's Gold, their Peace is beyond the worldling's Jewels, the priviledges which they are here inveſted with, are far more excellent than the largeſt earthly Poſſeſſions, which any worldlings have or hope to have; but the Riches which they ſhall have are far more tranſcendent; here they have only an earneſt Penny, in Heaven they ſhall have large ſums; here they have the firſt Fruits, in Heaven they ſhall reap the Harveſt; here they have the Deeds of Conveyance which give them title, in Heaven they ſhall have poſſeſſion of the uncorrupted and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Inheritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. <hi>They ſhall have treaſures in Heaven, which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Moth nor ruſt can corrupt, nor thieves break through to ſteal them away,</hi> Mat. 6.20. In Heaven every want will be ſupplied, every defect removed, every deſire ſatisfied; in their Father's Houſe there is plenty, and bread enough, which they ſhall be enriched and filled with, and which they ſhall live upon to all eternity; when Death ſhall turn others out of their houſes, rob them of their Eſtates, and bereave them of all that they have in the World, Death will befriend them, and convey them to the place where their Treaſure and Inheritance lyes, which they then ſhall be admitted to the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of, and never be turned out of poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In Heaven pardoned Perſons ſhall attain a ſtate of honour and dignity; here ſome of them, yea, all of them, are ſlighted and diſeſteemed, vilified and accounted as the filth and offſcouring of the World, and yet they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and in God's eſteem the moſt honourable, they are the Sons and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Lord Almighty, as hath been ſaid; but they ſhall be advanced far higher than they are, not to a high Seat upon earth, but a high Seat above the earth, yea, above the Stars and viſible Heavens, they ſhall ſit with Chriſt
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:95740:372"/> on his Throne, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. They ſhall have a Crown, not an Earthly Crown, but an Heavenly; not a Crown of Gold, <hi>but a Crown of Glory, which fadeth not away,</hi> 1 Pet. 5.4. They ſhall have a Kingdom, in compariſon of vvhich all the Kingdoms of the World are not vvorthy to be named, it is the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that is promiſed to them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.3. At the day of Chriſt's ſecond ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance they ſhall be honoured, vvhen they are ſent for by the Angels, and caught up in the Clouds to meet their Lord in the Air; then he vvill own and Crown them, and take them to live and reign vvith them for ever in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="4">4. In Heaven pardoned Perſons ſhall attain a ſtate of Holineſs and purity: here they are renewed but in part, and their Holineſs is imperfect, they find corruption remaining, and feel it daily vvorking in them, vvhich is the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt grief and trouble to them in the World: but in Heaven they ſhall be made perfect in Holineſs; they ſhall have not only perfect Peace, but alſo perfect purity, the being of ſin ſhall be removed, and all the ſpots and ſtains of it ſhall be vvaſhed away; in Heaven, as they ſhall ſigh no more, ſo they ſhall ſin no more; as they ſhall grieve no more, ſo they ſhall offend no more; nothing in Heaven ſhall offend them, and in Heaven they ſhall no more of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God; nothing in Heaven ſhall break their Peace, and they ſhall no more break God's Laws; in Heaven they ſhall be like the Angels, not only vvith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Marriage, but vvithout ſin, they ſhall be like to them in Holineſs and in happineſs; and this vvill be their happineſs to attain perfection in Holineſs.</p>
            <p n="5">5. In Heaven pardoned Perſons ſhall attain a ſtate of perfect happineſs and Glory in Soul and Body; their Souls ſhall be glorified and their Bodies glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified in Heaven.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In Heaven the Souls of pardoned Perſons ſhall be glorified; a ſhining excellency and marvellous ſpiritual beauty ſhall be put upon them, the Image of God vvill there be drawn to the life in them; all the faculties of their Souls vvill there be elevated, ennobled, and beautified vvith vvonderful perfections, and filled brim full vvith glory, ſuch as doth far exceed their preſent capacity; they ſhall have the brighteſt beams of light in their minds, the pureſt and ſweeteſt flames of love in their hearts, and that vvith ſuch heart-raviſhing joy as is to us unconceivable, but to them vvill both be full and everlaſting. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In Heaven the Bodies of pardoned Perſons vvill be glorified; their vile Bodies vvill be faſhioned into the likeneſs of Chriſt's moſt beautiful and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Body. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. All the defects and deformities vvhich ſome of their Bodies have here vvill be removed, and they ſhall ſhine like the new burniſht Heavens; vvhat a rare mixture of colours, vvhat an exact Symetry of parts their Bodies ſhall have, vvhat lovely Proportion and feature in their Face, vvhat ſparkling motions in the eye, vvhat graceful geſtures in the vvhole Body there vvill be, it is not for us to deſcribe, for the beauty of glorified Bodies vvill be beyond all deſcriptions. And thus much concerning the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture bleſſedneſs it ſelf vvhich pardoned Perſons ſhall have.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The ſecond thing is to prove that pardoned Perſons ſhall aſſuredly attain
<pb n="713" facs="tcp:95740:372"/> this future bleſſedneſs. This will appear by ſeveral Scriptures, and ſeveral Arguments drawn from the Scriptures.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Scriptures which prove that pardoned Perſons ſhall aſſuredly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain future bleſſedneſs are theſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. <hi>v.</hi> 7, and 11. compared. <hi>v.</hi> 7. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his Blood, the forgiveneſs of ſin according to the riches of his Grace.</hi> v. 11. <hi>In whom alſo we obtained an Inheritance.</hi> This Inheritance here ſpoken of can be no other than the Heavenly Inheritance, and the Apoſtle plainly aſſerteth that ſuch who had obtained the forgiveneſs of ſin, they had alſo obtained the Inheritance: in whom we have obtained, that is, they ſhall as certainly obtain it, as if they had it already in Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. A more full proof is in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo called, and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified, and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified;</hi> This is that Golden chain, ſo much ſpoken of by Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines, the links of which are ſo faſt joyned together, that all the power of men or Devils can never be able to pluck them aſunder. As ſuch whom God hath Predeſtinated before time, ſhall certainly be called and juſtified in time; ſo thoſe who are called and juſtified and ſo pardoned in time, ſhall certainly be glorified at the end of time, and when time ſhall be no more. And the third Scripture to prove this is, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. <hi>For if when we were ſinners we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled we ſhall be ſaved by his Life.</hi> Pardoned perſons are reconciled perſons, and if when they were ſinners they were reconciled through Chriſt's death and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, ſurely when reconciled, taken into favour, and become friends, they ſhall be ſaved not with a temporal, but with an eternal Salvation, by Chriſt's life and interceſſion, which hath ſufficient efficacy and prevalency to effect this thing for them. Here beſides the Apoſtle's aſſertion, he doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate an Argument for the proof of it; but I ſhall add ſome other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Arguments to prove that pardoned perſons ſhall moſt aſſuredly attain future bleſſedneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 1. The firſt Argument may be drawn from God's decree of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination or election. Whom God hath predeſtinated or elected to the bleſſedneſs of Heaven, they ſhall moſt aſſuredly attain it; But God hath predeſtinated or elected all pardoned perſons to the bleſſedneſs of Heaven, therefore they ſhall certainly attain it. That all ſuch whom God hath predeſtinated or elected unto the bleſſedneſs of Heaven ſhall certainly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it, is evident to any who impartially do read and weigh the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, which clearly do reveal the eternity of God's decree of particular predeſtination or election. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.4. <hi>According as he hath choſen us in him before the foundation of the World.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>Having predeſtinated us according to the good pleaſure of his will.</hi> God's decree of predeſtination or election (which is to eternal happineſs, therefore called an ordination to eternal life, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. an appointment and election to Salvation, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.13.) being eternal is therefore unchangeable, and therefore ſhall certainly be accompliſhed. If any thing hinder the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of God's decree, it muſt be either ſomething within him, or
<pb n="714" facs="tcp:95740:373"/> ſomething vvithout him; 1. Nothing vvithin him can hinder its accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, unleſs he ſhould change his own mind, and alter his decree, and this vvould infer a changeableneſs in God, vvhich is againſt both reaſon and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and beſides other imperfection, it vvould infer an imperfection in God's knowledg and vviſdom, that he did not foreſee or conſider thoſe after-reaſons, vvhich ſhould incline him unto a change from his firſt determination, and this is inconſiſtent vvith his infinite fore-knowledg, and eternal counſel of his vviſdom, in his vvilling and decreeing this thing; Men may change their purpoſes upon this account, but God ſo infinitely vviſe and ſore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, cannot do it. If he had fore-ſeen reaſon to have altered the thing, he vvould never have decreed or determined it. 2. Nothing vvithout God can hinder the accompliſhment of his decree, becauſe of his infinite power to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vvhat he hath deſigned, and againſt infinite power no reſiſtance can be made; the Elect vvhich the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> vvriteth unto, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. <hi>As they are choſen to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away, reſerved in Heaven for them,</hi> V. 4. <hi>So they are ſure to be kept by the power of God to Salvation,</hi> V. 5. And ſurely there can be no hindering of the Salvation and Bleſſedneſs of the Elect, vvho are kept for it or unto it by the Almighty power of God. And thus I think it is very clear, that all vvhom God hath predeſtinated or elected to bleſſedneſs ſhall certainly attain it. Hence are the vvords of the Apoſtle, vvhich may put all out of doubt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.11. <hi>In whom alſo we have obtained an Inheritance, being predeſtinated according to the purpoſe of him, who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That all pardoned perſons are predeſtinated or elected unto the bleſſedneſs of Heaven is alſo evident, becauſe pardon of ſin is the effect of predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. <hi>Whom he hath predeſtinated, them he alſo called and juſtified;</hi> Becauſe pardon of Sin is the means, and a neceſſary means of obtaining the bleſſedneſs of Heaven, vvhich God doth elect ſome of the Children of Men unto; and as vvhere-ever God doth elect to the end, he doth elect to the means, vvithout vvhich the end could not be accompliſhed; ſo vvhere-ever he doth elect to the means, he doth elect to the end, vvithout vvhich the means vvould be in vain: pardoned perſons having therefore obtained the means of bleſſedneſs, vvhich is remiſſion of ſin, vvithout vvhich they could have no admiſſion into Heaven, it is an evident ſign that they are choſen to this bleſſedneſs of Heaven; and moreover all pardoned perſons are true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, it being alone through Faith that any are juſtified and pardoned. <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by Faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Acts 10.43. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And all true believers are elected, true Faith being called the Faith of God's Elect, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.1. And ſuch are ordained to Eternal Life, <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained to Eternal Life believed.</hi> Faith is the fruit of our election; and our Saviour telleth the Jews, <hi>They did not believe becauſe they were not of his Sheep,</hi> Joh. 10.26. Therefore all pardoned perſons being true believers are elected, and therefore they ſhall certainly be ſaved, and attain the Eternal bleſſedneſs of Heaven.</p>
            <pb n="715" facs="tcp:95740:373"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 2. The Second Argument may be drawn from God's Covenant and promiſe. All thoſe to whom God is engaged by Covenant, and hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to give Eternal bleſſedneſs, they ſhall certainly attain Eternal bleſſedneſs: But God is engaged by Covenant, and hath promiſed to give Eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto all pardoned Perſons; therefore all pardoned Perſons ſhall certainly attain Eternal bleſſedneſs. That all ſuch to whom God is engaged by Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and hath promiſed to give Eternal happineſs, ſhall certainly attain it, is evident, becauſe of God's truth and faithfulneſs. <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.23. <hi>He is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful that hath promiſed.</hi> Numb. 23.19. <hi>God is not a Man that he ſhould lye, nor the Son of Man that he ſhould repent: hath he ſaid it, and will he not do it? hath he ſpoken it, and will he not make it good?</hi> Tit. 1.2. <hi>In hope of Eternal Life, which God that cannot lye, promiſed.</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18. <hi>Wherein God, willing more abundantly to ſhew to the Heirs of promiſe the immutability of his counſel, confirmed it by an Oath; That by two immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lye, we might have ſtrong conſolation.</hi> Therefore God's Covenant is called an everlaſting Covenant, and the mercies thereof, ſure mercies. Becauſe of his faithfulneſs; <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55.3. <hi>I will make an everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of David.</hi> It is clear then, that all thoſe to whom God is engaged by Covenant, and hath promiſed to give Eternal bleſſedneſs, they ſhall certainly attain it; becauſe otherwiſe God would prove unfaithful and a lyar, which is impoſſible. And it is clear that God hath engaged by Covenant, and hath promiſed to give Eternal bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to all pardoned perſons, becauſe they are all taken into Covenant, as hath been already proved; God is engaged by Covenant to be their God; and as our Saviour doth prove the Reſurrection of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was their God, ſo might I, by the ſame Argument, prove the Eternal bleſſedneſs of all pardoned perſons, becauſe God is their God, which relation doth engage him to make them perfectly and Eternally happy; but beſides this God hath expreſly promiſed Eternal happineſs. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.25. <hi>This is the promiſe which God hath promiſed us, even Eternal Life.</hi> Joh. 3.16. <hi>Whoſoever believeth in him ſhall not periſh, but have Everlaſting Life.</hi> Many other promiſes there are of the ſame import, all belonging to the Covenant of Grace, and all pardoned perſons being in this Covenant, they belong to them; they are made to believers, and all pardoned perſons are believers, therefore God is engaged by Covenant, and hath promiſed to give E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Life and bleſſedneſs unto them, and therefore they ſhall certainly attain it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 3. The Third Argument may be drawn from the union of all par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned perſons unto Chriſt, and his undertaking for them, to bring them unto Eternal bleſſedneſs. All thoſe who are united unto Chriſt, and whom he hath undertaken to bring to Eternal bleſſedneſs; they ſhall certainly attain Eternal bleſſedneſs: But all pardoned perſons are united unto Chriſt, and he hath undertaken to bring them to Eternal bleſſedneſs; therefore they ſhall certainly attain Eternal bleſſedneſs. All pardoned perſons being true belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, are by Faith united unto Chriſt, and ſo made members of the Body,
<pb n="716" facs="tcp:95740:374"/> whereof Chriſt is the Head, and Chriſt will not ſuffer any of his members to periſh: his body would not be compleat in Heaven, if he ſhould miſs any of his members there; they are eſpouſed unto Chriſt, and Chriſt will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring his Spouſe to his Father's houſe. The union between Chriſt and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers is indiſſoluble; and therefore as certainly as Chriſt is there, he will bring them thither too in the appointed time; they, by vertue of this union, are ſaid to be already <hi>in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> Eph. 2.6. They are there in their head, who hath for them taken poſſeſſion of thoſe places, and therefore he will ſurely give them poſſeſſion: He hath undertaken to do it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.27, 28. <hi>My Sheep hear my voice and they follow me, and I give unto them Eternal Life, and they ſhall never periſh, neither ſhall any Man pluck them out of mine hand.</hi> And Chriſt will make good his undertaking. As he hath made good his undertaking in purchaſing bleſſedneſs for them; ſo he will make good his undertaking to give them poſſeſſion of this bleſſedneſs; Therefore pardoned perſons ſhall certainly attain unto it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 4. The fourth Argument may be drawn from the Right, which pardoned perſons have unto Eternal bleſſedneſs: having a Right to it, they ſhall certainly attain it, God will not, cannot do them that wrong to keep them out of that Inheritance, or deny them that bleſſedneſs, which they can ſhew a right unto. Pardoned perſons have a double right to Eternal bleſſedneſs. 1. The right of Juſtification. 2. The right of Adoption.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have a right of Juſtification, wherein they are not only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted from guilt, but accepted as perfectly Righteous in God's ſight, through the imputation of Chriſt's perfect Righteouſneſs; and ſo they have received in the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> that right to Eternal Life, which they loſt in the firſt <hi>Adam;</hi> and it is a Righteous thing with God to give them this Eternal Life and bleſſedneſs, which perfect Righteouſneſs doth entitle unto.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have the right of Adoption as believers, they are the Children of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.26. <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And as Children they are heirs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. <hi>If Children, then heirs of God, and joynt heirs with Chriſt;</hi> and as heirs they have right to the Eternal In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and they ſhall certainly attain it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Arg.</hi> 5. The fifth Argument may be drawn from the certainty of all pardoned perſons perſeverance in Grace unto the end. All ſuch as perſevere in Grace unto the end, ſhall certainly obtain Eternal bleſſedneſs, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.15. <hi>He that ſhall endure to the end, the ſame ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Rev. 2.10. <hi>Be thou faithful unto death, and I will give thee a Crown of Life.</hi> Rom. 2. 6, 7. <hi>Who will render to every Man according to his deeds; to them who by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for Glory, and Honour, and Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, Eternal Life.</hi> All pardoned perſons ſhall perſevere in Grace
<pb n="717" facs="tcp:95740:374"/> unto the end; they ſhall not only perſevere through Faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5. but they ſhall perſevere in it. <hi>God will fulfil all the good pleaſure of his goodneſs in believers, and the work of Faith with power.</hi> 2 Theſ. 1.11. <hi>God will keep them in his hand, out of which none is able to pluck them.</hi> Joh. 10.29. <hi>He that hath begun a good work in them, will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form it until the day of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Phil. 1.6. God hath promiſed them to enable them to perſevere. <hi>I will make an everlaſting Covenant with them, and I will not turn away from them to do them good, but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me,</hi> Jer. 32.40. The Scripture is very full and clear in the Doctrine of the true believer's perſeverance: and all pardoned perſons being believers, as I have already ſhewed, all pardoned perſons ſhall perſevere to the end, and therefore ſhall certainly attain future Eternal bleſſedneſs of Heaven.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third particular to be ſpoken unto is, to ſhew how this future Eternal bleſſedneſs of Heaven doth render pardoned perſons bleſſed here upon the Earth; this will appear in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Pardoned perſons have a ſight of their future bleſſedneſs, and the excellency of it. 1. They have a ſight of the Eternal bleſſedneſs it ſelf, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. <hi>Chriſt hath aboliſhed death, and brought Life and Immortality to light through the Goſpel.</hi> The Lord hath made a clear Revelation in his Goſpel unto them, of that Eternal Life and bleſſedneſs, which he hath laid up in Heaven for them; This in former ages and generations was not made known to the Sons of Men, as now it is made known unto them by the Spirit of Chriſt in the Goſpel. Man by his fall, hath loſt his eyes, and cannot find the way unto Paradiſe, and this is one part of his miſery, that he doth not know what his chief happineſs is, nor how it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. The Heathen Philoſophers have had ſeveral hundred opinions concerning the chief good, and in all miſtaken; The Heathen Poets had fooliſh and groundleſs fancies of the <hi>Eliſian</hi> pleaſures and delights, which the Souls of the vertuous ſhould enjoy in the other world; but they were in the dark as to the true diſcovery of Heaven. The Saints themſelves had the future happineſs of Heaven diſcovered in a dark way, under Types, Figures, and Shadows; the earthly <hi>Canaan</hi> Typifying the Heavenly <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan;</hi> the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> below ſhadowing forth the <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> which is above; the Holy of Holies in the Temple made with hands, figuring the holy place made without hands eternal in the Heavens. But now the darkneſs is paſt, and the true light ſhineth, the ſhadows are fled, the vail before the Holieſt is rent, and the cloud in the Temple removed; ſo that now with open face, though ſtill in a glaſs, the glory which is above may be ſeen. The Goſpel doth reveal what Man's chiefeſt happineſs is, and wherein it doth conſiſt; that it doth not conſiſt in earthly riches, nor worldly honours, nor Epicurean pleaſures, nor the Stoick's <hi>Apathy,</hi> nor the Platoniſt's dark contemplation of <hi>Idea's,</hi> nor the Peripatetick's exerciſe
<pb n="718" facs="tcp:95740:375"/> of Moral vertues; but that God is the chief good of the Children of men; the Goſpel reveals God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt, and that man's chief hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs doth conſiſt in the Viſion and fruition of him begun here, and which will be perfected in Glory hereafter; the Goſpel reveals Heaven to pardoned ſinners, diſcovers the Holy of Holies that is above, and the way to it, as well as the Glories that are in it. And pardoned ſinners have not only a notional knowledg of the chief happineſs hereafter; But, ſecondly, they have a ſight of the excellency thereof, which cannot be ſeen by any carnal Eye, and this they have by the Eye of Faith and the light of the Spirit; by the Eye of Faith Heaven is realized to them, and made evident to their view in its tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent excellency, <hi>Faith being the ſubſtance of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. But this, as the Eye of Faith, is enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the Spirit of Wiſdom and revelation, whereby they perceive the Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the Glory of his Inheritance, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.17, 18. When the Apoſtle ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thoſe things which God hath prepared for them that love him, ſaith, <hi>That neither eye hath ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have they entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him;</hi> yet God ſaith, <hi>he hath revealed theſe things to us by his Spirit,</hi> 1 Cor. 2.9, 10. This foreſight of Heaven, and ſomething (although comparatively little) of the Glory and excellency thereof, doth render pardoned perſons bleſſed even in this World.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That which doth further contribute to the preſent bleſſedneſs of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned perſons, is not only their foreſight of future bleſſedneſs, but alſo their hopes of it, that they ſhall one day have poſſeſſion of ſo great felicity. They are bleſſed now in hopes of what they ſhall be; they carry about with them in their Boſoms the greateſt hopes of any in the World, and their hopes are ſuch as ſhall not make them aſhamed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. The hopes of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings make them aſhamed, in that either they fall ſhort of the thing which they hope for, God's providence oftentimes bringing upon them unthought of croſſes and unexpected diſappointments, yea, that which is quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to their hopes, diſgrace inſtead of honour, poverty inſtead of riches, trouble inſtead of peace, pain inſtead of pleaſure; yea, ſudden death, which cuts off them and their hopes together: or if they attain the thing which they hoped for, they are aſhamed of their hopes; in that they are always diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed of that ſatisfaction and contentment which they looked for in the thing; the waters of the Ciſtern cannot quench the thirſt of man's deſire; the Creatures cannot give more than they have, and they which hope for contentment in any thing beneath the chief good, muſt needs meet with a diſappointment; riches may fill the Houſe, Gold and Silver may fill the baggs, but none of theſe things can fill the heart; honour and eſteem of men may ſwell and puff up the mind, but the Soul cannot be filled unto ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction with Air, and Wind; ſenſual delights may cloy the Appetite, but the deſires of the Soul are too high and capacious for ſuch things to fill up. So that worldling's hopes muſt needs one way or other make them aſhamed, and ſo will the hopes of the Hypocrite too: but the hopes of pardoned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, which they have of future bleſſedneſs, have an excellency in them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the hopes of all others, and they ſhall never be aſhamed of them. The
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:95740:375"/> happineſs they hope for, they ſhall certainly have; none can deprive them of it; men cannot deprive them, they may take away their earthly Inheritance, but they cannot touch their Heavenly Inheritance; Devils cannot deprive them, they may attempt it, but they cannot effect it; Death cannot deprive them, death will bereave of whatever riches of the world any of them have, but it will put them into the poſſeſſion of their Treaſures in Heaven; none can deprive them but God, and God will not do it, as hath been already proved, and therefore their hopes are of a certain thing, which they ſhall not fail of; and withal they know that the happineſs of Heaven will exceed all their expectations, even the higheſt, which ever they have had of ſatisfaction and contentment there, that they ſhall find more ſweetneſs and joy there than ever hath entred into their hearts to conceive; and therefore their hopes ſhall not make them aſhamed; yea, in their very hopes of Heaven, eſpecially at ſome times, they find more real ſatisfaction, than ever was found by any in the fulleſt and ſweeteſt enjoyment, which they have had of the good things of this life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Pardoned perſons have the beginnings of future bleſſedneſs here, in this life, in the Work of Grace, and ſometimes foretaſts and firſt fruits of it, through the witneſs, ſeal, and earneſt of the Spirit; and this renders them bleſſed in this life.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They have the beginnings of Heaven in the work of Grace upon their hearts. Grace is the beginning of Glory; Grace is Glory in the bud, Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is Grace in the flower, and when the work of Grace is carried on, the Scripture ſaith, that they proceed from Glory to Glory. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>But we all with open face beholding as in a Glaſs the Glory of the Lord, are changed into the ſame Image from Glory to Glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord:</hi> They are happy here, as they have ſome degrees of that Holineſs and likeneſs unto God, in the perfection of which hereafter in Heaven their perfect hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs doth conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have the beginnings of Heaven in the firſt fruits and foretaſts of it through the witneſs, ſeal, and earneſt of the Spirit; God ſometimes gives them firſt fruits of the Heavenly <hi>Canaan,</hi> he ſends in a few bunches of thoſe ſweet Grapes that are there, and lets them have ſome foretaſts of thoſe Soul-raviſhing Heavenly joys which hereafter will be full and for ever abiding; he ſometimes takes them up into the Mount, and gives them a <hi>Piſgah</hi>-ſight of the Land of promiſe through the proſpective-Glaſs of his Ordinances; he brings ſome even to the Gate of the New <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in their Heavenly Contemplations, and lets out ſuch beams of that Glorious Heavenly light, and drops into their hearts ſuch taſte of future joys, through the ſudden elap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Spirit of Glory upon them, that they are rapt up into an extaſie, and ſuch a ſweetneſs they feel in their Spirits as is ineffable, ſuch as words cannot utter, nor the minds of any conceive, but thoſe that have had the like; when God giveth them the witneſs of his Spirit, that they ſhall aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly attain eternal life, and ſealeth them up by his Spirit to the day of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, he doth commonly give the earneſt alſo of the Spirit in ſome Soul-raviſhing joys, in compariſon of which the ſofteſt pleaſures of the
<pb n="720" facs="tcp:95740:376"/> fleſh, and the ſweeteſt delights that can ariſe from any objects of ſenſe, are moſt vain, thin, empty, and not worthy to be named with them. And thus the Eternal bleſſedneſs which pardoned perſons ſhall have, doth render them bleſſed here in this life beyond all others, whatever confluence of good things they be ſurrounded withal. The fore-ſight, firſt fruits, hopes, and ſweet fore-taſtes of this future bleſſedneſs, do ſweeten their life; but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially they do ſweeten their death, they knowing that death will be their friend, and prove an out-let to all earthly miſery, and an in-let to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory; that death will open the priſon doors of this world unto them, and uſher them into the palace of the great King; they know their death will be like a Ship to convey them over Sea, as it were, from the far, ſtrange, and Enemies Countrey, unto the heavenly Countrey, where their glorious <hi>Jehovah,</hi> their heavenly Father, where the Lord Jeſus Chriſt their elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and dear Saviour, and where the departed Saints, their chief kinred, are together, and where their inheritance doth lye, and where they ſhall take up their Eternal abode. Where pardoned perſons have a clear fore-ſight, and ſtrong hope of this, death is no more to them than a ſleep; they can as willingly put off their fleſh and go into their graves, as they can put off their clothes at night to go into their beds, they can as willingly compoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to die, as they can compoſe themſelves to ſleep after a weary day.</p>
            <p>Thus much for the proof of the bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs, or of all thoſe perſons whoſe ſins are pardoned.</p>
            <p>Queſt. 2. <hi>The ſecond Queſtion, wherein I muſt be more ſhort, is, How this bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs may be attained?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs may be attained; there are ſome things muſt be known and believed; and there are ſome things muſt be done and practiſed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Some things muſt be believed: I ſhall inſtance in one or two chief Doctrines of the Goſpel, which all ſinners muſt know and believe if they would attain forgiveneſs of ſin. The Firſt is, The Doctrine of Chriſt's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto God's Juſtice for the ſins of men. The Second is, The Doctrine of juſtification by the righteouſneſs of Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinners muſt know and believe the Doctrine of Chriſt's ſatisfaction unto the Juſtice of God for the ſins of Men. To diſcourſe fully of this great Doctrine of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, would require a Treatiſe which might fill a great volume, but I muſt comprize it within a little room; who am to ſpeak of it, only in the direction of a Sermon. Briefly, 1. That there is abſolute need of ſatisfaction to God's juſtice for the ſins of men, without which forgiveneſs of ſins would be impoſſible and utterly unattaina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is evident both from the nature of God's juſtice, which doth oblige him to puniſh all ſinners Eternally without it, and from the truth of God's threatnings, wherein he hath revealed that he will thus puniſh them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out it. 2. That there is need of the ſatisfaction of Chriſt is evident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="721" facs="tcp:95740:376"/> ſinners themſelves being finite, cannot give that ſatisfaction unto God, which ſhall bear any proportion to the demands of his infinite juſtice, and if any be in a capacity to give it, it muſt be ſuch a one, as is both innocent, and ſo cannot ſuffer for his own faults, and whoſe perſon is of infinite dignity, that thence may ariſe an equivalency of merit in his ſufferings, as may prove ſatisfactory to God's infinite juſtice; and becauſe no mere man, being a finite creature, hath this dignity, and God cannot ſuffer, becauſe this would argue weakneſs and infirmity, which is infinitely removed from him; therefore it is requiſite that the perſon who can ſatisfie ſhould be God-man, that as in one nature he may be capable of ſuffering, ſo the other nature may put a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and efficacy upon it; and ſuch a perſon was Jeſus Chriſt. 3. That Jeſus Chriſt hath done that which is ſufficient to ſatisfie God's juſtice for the ſins of men, is evident from his Death and other ſufferings which we have upon record in the Goſpel; which ſufferings were not for himſelf, he being an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent perſon; and it would have argued injuſtice in God, had he permitted ſuch ſufferings to have been laid on his body, eſpecially had he himſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted ſuch dreadful inward ſufferings on his Soul, were it not that he ſtood in the room of ſinners, and endured all theſe ſufferings for their ſins, that he might give ſatisfaction to his juſtice hereby. 4. That Chriſt's ſufferings have given to God ſatisfaction, and that he hath accepted of this ſatisfaction in the behalf of ſinners, is evident from the Compact and Covenant which he made with Chriſt, that if he would offer up this ſacrifice of himſelf, he would be well pleaſed, and ſinners ſhould hereby be juſtified; from his ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Son into the world for this very end, and anointing him to the office of High-Prieſt, that he might firſt make ſatisfaction, and then Interceſſion, for the people; from his owning him when here, raiſing him when dead; receiving him to glory when raiſed, which he would not have done, had not he accepted his ſatisfaction; from his Covenant he hath through him made with man, and promiſes therein of remiſſion of ſins through his blood, which he would never have made, had not Chriſt's death given him ſatisfaction. Moreover, all thoſe places of Scripture which ſpeak of Chriſt's death as a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, as a ranſom, as a puniſhment, which he endured that ſinners might be, and whereby believers are, actually reconciled unto God, do clearly and abundantly prove that Chriſt hath given ſatisfaction to God's juſtice, and which God is well pleaſed withal. 5. That all ſinners muſt know and believe this Doctrine of Chriſt's ſatisfaction, that they may attain remiſſion of ſins is evident, becauſe God never did, never will forgive any ſin without reſpect unto it; this way of remiſſion is the chief thing which he hath revealed in the Scriptures; In the Old Teſtament it was ſhadowed under the ſacrifices for ſin which were offered; in the New Teſtament it is the end of the Revelation of Chriſt, this being the chief deſign of his ſufferings and death, to give ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to God's juſtice, in order to the forgiveneſs of man's ſin. And they that are ignorant hereof, or do not believe this, do not know nor believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and him crucified, and therefore cannot obtain forgiveneſs by his death.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="722" facs="tcp:95740:377"/>2. Sinners muſt know and believe the doctrine of Juſtification by Chriſt's Righteouſneſs, that they may attain remiſſion of ſins. 1. They muſt know the nature of Juſtification it ſelf, that it doth conſiſt in the remiſſion of our ſins, and the acceptation of our Perſons, as perfectly Righteous in God's ſight; they muſt know that they have no Righteouſneſs of their own to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent God withal, becauſe guilty of ſin, and the leaſt guilt is inconſiſtent with a perfect Righteouſneſs, and therefore if they were, as ſome are, really Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, yet that they could not be accepted as perfectly Righteous in God's ſight, upon the account of a perfect Righteouſneſs of their own, which none here do attain unto, much leſs when they are naturally void and empty of all good and real Holineſs, and polluted all over with Sin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They muſt know that the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is perfect, and was intended for them, and held forth to them, which they muſt ſubmit unto, and accept of, if they would be juſtified in God's ſight.</p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt is made theirs by Faith, God impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it and accounting it unto believers, as if it were their own, and they had wrought it out in their own perſons. This way of Juſtification by Chriſt all muſt know, and be perſwaded of, that would obtain Juſtification, which doth include forgiveneſs of ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Some things muſt be done and practiſed by ſinners, that they may attain this bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They muſt get conviction of ſin. 2. They muſt make confeſſion of ſin. 3. They muſt by Faith make Application of Jeſus Chriſt. 4. They muſt forſake ſin. 5. They muſt make Supplication and earneſt Prayer unto God for pardoning Mercy. 6. They muſt forgive others.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Sinners, would you attain the bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs? Labour to get conviction of ſin; get conviction of your Original ſin, the guilt of <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt ſin in which you are involv'd, your preſent emptineſs of all Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual good, and the Univerſal depravation of all the powers and faculties of your Souls with inherent pollution, which renders you oppoſite unto all real good, and naturally prone unto nothing but evil; get conviction of your actual ſins, of all your hainous breaches of God's Law, whether the firſt or ſecond Table of it, whether ſins againſt God more immediately, his Nature, his Worſhip, his Name, his Day, or againſt your Neighbour, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative ſins, or ſins againſt the life, or chaſtity or eſtate or good name of any; and get conviction that all inordinate motions that have not the conſent of the will, and much more inordinate affections which are influenced by it, are ſinful and provoking unto God; Get alſo convictions of your more hainous diſobedience to the Goſpel, what an aggravation it is of all your other ſins that you have repented of none, when you have ſo much need, and have been ſo often called hereunto; what an affront is it unto God, a diſparage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto Chriſt, that you have neglected your Salvation by him, and have been guilty of unbelief in not receiving, yea refuſing Chriſt, ſo able and
<pb n="723" facs="tcp:95740:377"/> willing to ſave you, and when you have had ſuch frequent and earneſt as well as gracious and free tenders of him? Get conviction of the guilt of your ſins, and what an Obligation you are under hereby to undergo eternal Deſtruction in the flames of Hell fire for it, and let this awaken you out of your ſecurity, let the thoughts of this pierce and wound your conſciences, and make you cry out with thoſe Sinners which were convinced by <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37. <hi>When they heard this they were pricked in their heart, and ſaid unto Peter and the reſt of the Apoſtles: Men and brethren what ſhall we do?</hi> Get conviction alſo of the horrid baſeneſs and ungratefulneſs of ſin, as it diſhonours and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſes that God by whom you were at firſt created, are continually preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and maintained; and who, though he could ſo eaſily deſtroy you, and glorifie his juſtice hereby, yet is both patient with you, and willing alſo to be reconciled unto you, and ſends his Embaſſadors in his name to tell you that he entreats you that you would be reconciled, and let theſe conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons affect you with ingenuous grief for ſin. Laſtly, Get conviction of the defilement of ſin, how your Souls are ſtained by it, and hereby degenerated and debaſed into a lower degree of vileneſs than is in the beaſt that periſheth, yea, that hereby you are become without regeneration, and until your Souls are waſhed, more loathſom in the eyes of God, than the moſt naſty thing in the World is in your eyes.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Make confeſſion of ſin. In ſome caſes it is requiſite you ſhould confeſs ſome ſins unto man, but it is abſolutely univerſally neceſſary in order to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, that you ſhould confeſs your ſins unto God; the promiſe of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning mercy is made to confeſſion. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that covereth his ſins ſhall not proſper, but he that confeſſeth and forſaketh them ſhall have mercy. David</hi> found by experience the evil of covering and keeping cloſe his ſins, and the benefit of acknowledgment and confeſſion. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.3, 4, 5. <hi>When I kept ſilence my bones waxed old through my roaring all the day long: for day and night thine hand was heavy upon me; my moiſture is turned into the drought of Summer. Selah. I acknowledged my ſin unto thee, and my iniquity have I not hid: I ſaid I will confeſs my tranſgreſſions unto the Lord, and thou forgaveſt the iniquity of my ſin. Selah.</hi> Sinners, make a full confeſſion of your ſins, that you may have a full pardon and diſcharge; do not hide any ſin as a ſweet morſel under your tongue; it is a vain thing to ſeek and endeavour the hiding of any ſin from him who is omniſcient, God hath knowledg of all your Iniquities, do you therefore acknowledg all unto him. Make free confeſſion of your ſins. Stay not till God force you by his Scourges, and even drag you unto it by his cords of affliction; but let it be your voluntary act, and be ingenuous herein; mingle not your confeſſion with excuſes and extenuations. Say not, though you are bad, yet you are not ſo bad as others: that your hearts are good, though your lives have been naught; that ſuch and ſuch groſs ſins were your ſlips and failings; that you were overtaken, overperſwaded, and drawn unto ſuch wicked practices by your companions; and ſo, by transferring your guilt, endeavour to make your ſelves as Innocent as you can; this is abominable in the ſight of God, and a certain ſign of ſin's dominion, which is incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent
<pb n="724" facs="tcp:95740:378"/> with the remiſſion of it, and will ſhut you out from pardoning Mercy: but in confeſſion of your ſins, acknowledg your ſelves to have been the chief of ſinners. Sinners, take all the blame to your ſelves, and ſet your ſins out in the deepeſt Crimſon and Scarlet colours, and with all their hainous circumſtances and aggravations; tell God that your heart is the worſt part, and if there have been ſome abominations found in your lives, there are a thouſand-fold more abominations in your hearts. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs your ſins with humility and ſelf-loathing; ſay with <hi>Agur,</hi> Prov. 30.2. <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh than any man, and have not the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a man;</hi> with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 73.22. <hi>So fooliſh was I and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I was as a Beaſt before thee;</hi> with <hi>Job,</hi> Chap. 42.6. <hi>I abhor my ſelf, and repent in duſt and aſhes.</hi> Confeſs your ſins with ſhame like <hi>Ezra,</hi> Chap. 9.6. <hi>O my God I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift my face unto thee: for our iniquities are increaſed over our head, and our treſpaſs is grown up unto the Heavens.</hi> Confeſs your ſins with grief and godly ſorrow like <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 39.18. <hi>I will declare mine iniquity, I will be ſorry for ſin.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Make Application of Chriſt by Faith, that you may attain forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>There is no other Name given under Heaven amongſt men whereby you can be pardoned and ſaved:</hi> Acts 4.12. <hi>And he is able to ſave you, and procure a pardon for you in the uttermoſt extent of your moſt hainous guilt.</hi> Heb. 7.25. And the reaſon is given in the ſame Verſe, <hi>becauſe he ever liveth to make Interceſſion for ſinners; it is his Office as High-Prieſt, wherein he is moſt merciful and faithful to make Reconciliation for the ſins of the People:</hi> Heb. 2.17. Chriſt is near to the Father, being at his right hand in Heaven; and hath great intereſt in him, being his dearly beloved Son; and his Interceſſion for pardon is always accepted, it being for no more than what himſelf hath purchaſed, and what his Father hath promiſed: and therefore you that are the worſt of Sinners have great encouragement to come unto Chriſt, and to make Application of him; you have his promiſe <hi>that whoſoever cometh unto him, he will in no wiſe caſt out,</hi> Joh. 6.37. and if you apply your ſelves unto him, and apply unto your ſelves his merits and Righteouſneſs by believing, you ſhall certainly attain the forgiveneſs of all your ſins, however numerous and hainous they have been. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets witneſs, that through his Name whoſoever believeth in him ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> And our Saviour himſelf telleth us, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>God ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life.</hi> And the Apoſtle doth diſcourſe at large in the former part of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> concerning Juſtification, which he proveth by manifold Arguments, that it cannot be works, that it muſt be by Faith; therefore by Faith make Application of Chriſt and his imputed Righteouſneſs, and reſt therein only that you may be juſtified, that you may be pardoned and ſaved.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Forſake every ſin, that you may attain the forgiveneſs of it. <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.13. <hi>He that confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins ſhall find mercy.</hi> Iſa. 55.7.
<pb n="725" facs="tcp:95740:378"/> 
               <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and return to the Lord, for he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon him.</hi> Iſa. 1.16, 17, 18. <hi>Waſh ye, make ye clean, put away the evil of your doing from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil, learn to do well, ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, judg the fatherleſs, plead for the widow. Come now and let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord; though your ſins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow, though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi> You muſt loath your ſins, that you may be pardoned; and withal you muſt leave them, you muſt ceaſe from doing evil, if you would have God ceaſe from his diſpleaſure: and unleſs you do forſake your ſins, never expect that God ſhould forgive them; there muſt be a returning to God, that you may be received unto favour, and this cannot be without a turning from ſin. It would be a diſhonour unto God to pardon you whilſt that you continue in your rebellions, and wage War ſtill againſt Heaven by going on ſtill in your treſpaſſes.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Make your Supplication unto God, and be earneſt in Prayer unto him, that he would forgive you your ſins; it is againſt God that your ſins have been committed, and it is God's Prerogative to remit and pardon, and though he pardon freely for his Name's ſake, yet he will be enquired after and ſought unto for his high favour. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 43.25, 26. <hi>I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy Tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake, and will not remember thy ſins. Put me in remembrance,</hi> &amp;c. If you would have pardon, you muſt ask it; if you would find God's favour, you muſt ſeek it; if you deſire the door of Mercy to be opened unto you, you muſt knock at the door by earneſt Prayer, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.7. Hence are <hi>David</hi>'s earneſt cryes in Prayer for pardoning Mercy in ſo many of his <hi>Pſalms,</hi> eſpecially <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. in the firſt verſe, <hi>Have Mercy upon me O God ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to thy loving kindneſs, according to the multitude of thy tender Mercies blot out my tranſgreſſions.</hi> v. 9. <hi>Hide thy face from my ſins, and blot out mine iniquities.</hi> v. 14. <hi>Deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs O God, thou God of my Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. Be earneſt in Prayer at the Throne of Grace for this bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs, wreſtle with God by importunate Supplications, fill your mouths with Arguments, plead the gracious diſpoſition of God, the multitude of his tender Mercies, and the riches of his free Grace; plead the Glory of his Name, which would greatly be advanced and admired, if your great ſins might be pardoned; plead the merits of Chriſt, and Satisfaction given to his juſtice by his Son, together with his Interceſſion for you at his right hand; plead the promiſes of the Covenant of Grace, and his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which doth engage him to fulfil them; humble, believing, fervent Prayer will prevail for forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Forgive others, if you would that God ſhould forgive you: <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.11. <hi>Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</hi> v. 14, 15. <hi>For if you forgive men their treſpaſſes, your heavenly Father will alſo forgive you; but if you forgive not men their treſpaſſes, neither will your heavenly Father forgive your treſpaſſes.</hi> If you do not forgive the hundred Pence of ſmaller offences unto your fellow-ſervants, you will be called to an account, and impriſoned in Hell, and there
<pb n="726" facs="tcp:95740:379"/> tormented for the ten thouſand Talents of hainous tranſgreſſions which you have committed againſt your Lord, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18. at the latter end of that Chap. If you bear hatred and malice and revenge in your hearts againſt others, whatever their offences, their wrongs or injuries have been, you put your ſelves out of capacity of obtaining pardoning Mercy; Do not ſay, I forgive ſuch a one who hath wronged me, but I will never forget him, for this is a deceit of your hearts, whereby you ſeek to ſtop the mouth of your conſciences, that they may not trouble you by theſe Scriptures; for if you do not forget injuries, ſo as to carry it towards ſuch Perſons as if they had not wronged you, ſo as to love them cordially, and to be ready to ſhew kindneſs unto them, you do not forgive them, and ſo you cannot be forgiven by God. If then you would be pardoned by God, you muſt from the heart forgive others, receive the Exhortation of the Apoſtle: <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.31, 32. <hi>Let all bitterneſs, and wrath, and anger, and clamour, and evil ſpeaking, be put away from you, with all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. And be kind one to another, tender-hearted, forgiving one another, even as God for Chriſt's ſake hath forgiven you.</hi> Thus I have finiſhed my Anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the two Queries, wherein doth appear the bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs, and how this bleſſedneſs may be attained; and now give me leave to borrow a little room for ſome Application.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Application.</hi> I might ſpeak much here by way of comfort unto pardoned Perſons, but the moſt that I have already ſpoken, yea all that I have ſpoken under the firſt Query, may be turned into a Uſe of comfort to your ſelves, and therefore referring you thither I ſhall paſs you by, and bend my ſpeech only unto you that are unpardoned, too many of whom are to be found in every Aſſembly, and therefore I cannot think that this Aſſembly is free.</p>
            <p>I ſhall take leave to chide you in a Uſe of Reproof; endeavour to awaken you in a Uſe of Terror; and in the concluſion preſs you to endeavour after this bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs in an Uſe of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For Reproof; Is there ſuch bleſſedneſs in forgiveneſs? Whence is it then that ſo many of you neglect this bleſſedneſs, in the neglect of your pardon? Are not all of you ſinners? Have not all of you need of forgiveneſs? Will not your own Conſciences tell you that forgiveneſs is a great priviledg? And have not Miniſters often told you of this priviledg, and the way of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it? Hath not God by them held forth a pardon to you, and uſed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny arguments with you, that you would accept it? Whence is it then that ſo many of you ſlight and undervalue it, as if it were of no worth? Whence is it that ſo many of you are without pardon when profered, when none of you are without ſins often committed, and thoſe highly aggravated, and whereby your Souls are ſo greatly endangered? May not Robbers, and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, and other notorious Malefactors, riſe up in judgment againſt you that are without a pardon? When ſuch Perſons are apprehended, found guilty, and condemned, though but unto a temporal death, they will make all friends, and uſe all means to eſcape, and O! how welcome is a pardon to them? And yet, though you are all guilty of ſin, and condemned for it unto eternal death,
<pb n="727" facs="tcp:95740:379"/> and a pardon is purchaſed, proclaimed, and profered unto you, there are too many of you that ſlight and neglect it, that have no earneſt deſire after it, and hitherto have not been perſwaded by any arguments to make uſe of the means which God hath appointed with any diligence for the obtaining of it. Who is there that to any purpoſe doth look after a pardon? Who do di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently hear for it, earneſtly pray for it? Who do make full and free confeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſin, that you may attain remiſſion of it? Who do prize Chriſt, and by Faith make application of him, that they may have a pardon by him? Who do forſake ſin, which God abſolutely requires of all to whom he doth forgive ſin? Who do, when injur'd, heartily forgive others, as they deſire God would forgive them? Sinners, will not many of your conſciences accuſe you of unpardoned guilt, unto which you have added the neglect of forgiveneſs? And is not your ſin hereby doubled, and moſt highly aggravated, and the guilt of it faſtned upon you?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Let me tell you by way of Terror for your awakening, that God is diſpleaſed with all workers of iniquity, but he is moſt highly diſpleaſed with you that ſlight his mercy. Your ſins are inexcuſable, your condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is unavoidable, and your puniſhment hereafter in Hell will be moſt dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and intolerable. Poſſibly now you are careleſs and ſecure; ſin is ſweet, and conſcience is quiet; you are at eaſe, and conſcience aſleep; but will this eaſe and ſleep always continue? Is there not a time coming when you ſhall be awakened? If you are not awakened under God's Word, may not God awa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken you under his Rod? If you are not awakened under God's threatnings, will you not awake when he cometh to execution? If you are ſecure in the midſt of outward peace and proſperity, can you be ſecure in the midſt of trouble and adverſity? Think what you will do when death doth approach: Think what a dreadful aſpect unpardoned ſin will have, when you are brought down unto the ſides of the pit, to the brink and border of eternity, and when you are ſummoned to make your appearance before the higheſt Majeſty: O the horrour that then will ſeize you! O the fearfulneſs that then will ſurpriſe you! To have the black guilt of drunkenneſs or ſwearing, of uncleanneſs or deceiving, or any other iniquity to ſtare you then in the face, O how diſmal will it be and affrighting! And think with what rage and fury your conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces will then reflect upon your fore-paſt ſins; eſpecially your neglect of a pardon, then unattainable, and how tormenting will this be unto you? You may then cry out, Lord have mercy on us; Chriſt have mercy on us; But will God then hear you who have refuſed to hearken unto him? Will Chriſt regard you, who have neglected, refuſed, and ſhut the door of your hearts againſt him all your days? But ſinners, what will you do at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall come in flaming fire to take vengeance upon you for unpardoned ſins? That great day will certainly come, and it will quickly be here: Time runs away ſwiftly, and it will quickly be run out; yet a little while and the Angel will lift up his hand, and cry with a loud voice, <hi>and ſwear by him that liveth for ever and ever that time ſhall be no longer,</hi> Rev. 10.5, 6. Then the myſtery will be finiſhed, the propheſie ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed,
<pb n="728" facs="tcp:95740:380"/> and the whole frame of this viſible world diſſolved; the Sun then and the Moon will be darkened, and the Stars will fall unto the earth, as the fig-tree caſteth her untimely figs, when ſhe is ſhaken of a mighty wind; and the heavens themſelves then ſhall be rolled together as a great ſcroll, and ſo paſs away with a great noiſe; the earth and all the elements ſhall be on fire, and conſume away on that day, when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſhall appear from Heaven with Millions of mighty Angels, in power and brightneſs of majeſty, and then you muſt come out of your graves, and will ſtand trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling before Chriſt's great Tribunal, and none of you will be able to hide your ſelves under any Rock or Mountain from his angry face. Then, then you will fully know what a priviledg it is to be pardoned, when you ſee where pardoned perſons are placed, when you ſee them gathered to the right hand of the great Judg, and there acquitted openly, owned graciouſly, and crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by him with honour and glory, and invited by him to take poſſeſſion of thoſe eternal habitations of reſt and joy in his Kingdom prepared for them by his Father: But O the tearings of ſpirit, and heart-vexing tormenting grief which you will have, that no place is found for you amongſt them, that through your neglect of pardoning mercy you have forfeited and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally loſt a ſhare in eternal glory; and not only ſo, but have by ſin alſo plunged your ſelves into a bottomleſs gulf of endleſs miſery! Think how dreadful the irreverſible ſentence of condemnation will be unto you, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed into everlaſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> Alas! Alas! ſinners what will you do? no thought can conceive what your horror will be, when you come to reap the bitter fruit of all your unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſins. It is the puniſhment of Hell, Sinners, which the guilt of ſin unremoved doth oblige you to undergo; And therefore I am ſent this day to forewarn you, and in the name of my Maſter to foretel you, that if you do not now ſue out for, and obtain this forgiveneſs of ſin, your ſin here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after will bring eternal ruine and deſtruction of ſoul and body in Hell. Without a pardon profaneneſs will be your ruine: Some of you it may be can ſwear and curſe and blaſpheme the Name of God; hereafter God will ſwear in his wrath that you ſhall not enter into his reſt, and you ſhall be baniſhed out of Chriſt's preſence with a curſe, <hi>Depart from me ye curſed,</hi> &amp;c. Thoſe tongues which have been ſo liberal of oaths and blaſphemies, muſt be tormented in flames of fire without one drop of water to cool them. Without a pardon, drunkenneſs will be your ruine: you that have ſo often enflamed your ſelves with wine and ſtrong drink. God will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flame you with the wine of his vengeance, he will make you to drink the dregs of his wrath, which is at the bottom of the cup of his indignation. Without a pardon, uncleanneſs will be your ruine: your pleaſures are empty and of ſhort continuance, but your pains will be full hereafter, and they will abide for ever. Without a pardon, unrighteouſneſs will be your ruine: your unrighteous gains one day will prove your unſpeakable loſs, and God will be the avenger of all ſuch upon you as have been wronged and defrauded by you. Without a pardon, your neglect of Chriſt and Salvation will be your ruine, and if you perſevere in this neglect, it
<pb n="729" facs="tcp:95740:380"/> is impoſſible that you ſhould eſcape. Sinners, think ſeriouſly and think frequently of your unpardoned iniquities, and withal think of the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful puniſhment they will bring upon you, think of your eternal damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the moſt exquiſite torments of Hell; and then drink on, ſwear on, and ſcoff your fill, be unholy and profane, unjuſt and unclean if you think good; but know that for all theſe ſins God will bring you to judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, know that theſe iniquities unpardoned will be your ruine. Should I tell you of one that were condemned for ſome vile fact to be ſlay'd alive, or burnt alive, or ſawn aſunder, or dragg'd to pieces with wild horſes, or ſtarv'd with hunger and cold, or any other ways cruelly tortured to death; but that he might eſcape all this miſery, if he would accept of a pardon ready provided for him, and withal leave off ſuch vile facts for the future; you would count him worſe than mad, ſhould he neglect his pardon, and expoſe himſelf to ruine and miſery through his careleſneſs and obſtinacy: And yet though you are condemned for ſin to far worſe torment and miſery, that which is more dreadful than ten thouſand painful deaths, and all this miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief and puniſhment may be avoided and eſcaped, if you will accept of the pardon which Chriſt hath provided, and in the Goſpel is profered unto you, and withal break off your ſins by repentance; yet no words or arguments will perſwade you to uſe the means of prevention, but ſtill you live in the neglect of pardon and ſo great ſalvation, and are ſecure, however great your danger be. O the folly and ſtrange madneſs of unconverted ſinners! O the unſpeakable ſottiſhneſs and ſenſleſneſs they are under! Although we make it appear to their conſciences that their condition is unutterably miſerable, they are not moved, except it be with choler againſt the Miniſter that warns them of the ſword of God's vengeance which hangeth over them, and they champ at the Bridle that would hold them from running to their deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: But O that you would rather turn your anger againſt your ſins, and ſay, this iniquity will be my ruine, and that ſin without pardon will be my damnation.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. Therefore in the next place let me exhort all of you that lye under the guilt of ſin, that you would labour after this bleſſedneſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs. O that you would pity your own ſouls, think what proviſion you have made for them, think whither they are like to go upon their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from your bodies, and what you will do at the laſt day when Chriſt cometh to judg and puniſh unpardoned ſinners; think how you will be able to dwell with devouring fire, to inhabit everlaſting burnings. Methinks you ſhould take up ſuch thoughts as theſe, and argue thus with your ſelves; <hi>What! Shall I undo my ſelf for a filthy luſt? Shall I loſe my Soul to gain a little uncertain earthly riches? Shall I forfeit a Crown of Glory for the empty honour of this world? Shall I caſt my ſelf into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting horrour and pain for a little vain, fading, carnal delight and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Can I be contented to be tormented for ever in Hell to ſatisfie the deſires of my fleſh on earth, and that when they will never be ſatisfied? Shall I hugg a viper in my boſom that will kill me? Harbour luſts in my heart that will ſlay me? Shall I diſhonour God, and damn my own ſoul, to
<pb n="730" facs="tcp:95740:381"/> gratifie the Devil my enemy, and pleaſe my fleſh, which will ſoon be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into dirt and rottenneſs, and withal throw away the hopes of a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious reſurrection for my body hereby? Away then ye fooliſh filthy luſts, I'le no more hearken to you, or be entangled or enſlaved by you. Be gone thou deluding tempting Devil, I'le lend my ear no longer to thy lying ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, nor yield any more to thy beguiling and bewitching temptations; farewel thou glozing flattering world, with all thy charmes and allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, thy gold is but droſs, thy wine mixt with water, thy honour but wind and vanity, thy delights are bitter-ſweets, ſuch as will end in death and ruine, I'le chooſe another portion, and look after a better bleſſedneſs, than thou canſt give me, even the bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs, which will bring me unto eternal bleſſedneſs.</hi> Methinks you ſhould take no ſleep nor reſt, and find no comfort in houſe, or trade, or friends, or any thing, until the anger of God be appeaſed, your ſins all pardoned, and ſo your ſouls ſet in ſafety from all that ruine unto which they are expoſed by unpardoned ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity. The abſolute neceſſity of forgiveneſs ſhould quicken you to look after it; you have not ſo much need of food to remove your hunger, as you have need of mercy to remove your guilt; you have not ſo much need of clothes to cover your bodies, as you have need of righteouſneſs to cover your iniquities. Better be ſtarv'd than damn'd, better be hang'd than burn'd, better be expoſed to the miſery of the weather, and any bodily diſtemper, than to be expoſed unto the ſtorms and ſtrokes of God's vengeance, and the eternal ruine of body and ſoul in Hell, which there is no poſſibility of eſcaping without a pardon. And that which may encourage you to ſeek after forgiveneſs is the attainableneſs of it, and that by the vileſt and moſt guilty amongſt you: others have obtained pardoning mercy that have been found as guilty: <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> was pardoned who was ſo hainous a tranſgreſſor; <hi>Paul,</hi> who was ſo Zealous a Perſecutor; <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> who was poſſeſſed with ſeven Devils; the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> ſome of whom were Idolaters, Adulterers, effeminate, abuſers of themſelves with mankind, Theeves, Covetous, Extortioners, Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards, Revilers; yet they were juſtified in the Name of the Lord Jeſus; ſome of them who had imbrued their hands in Chriſt's Blood, had the guilt of their ſins waſhed away by it. There is Mercy enough in God to give a pardon for the greateſt Tranſgreſſion; there is merit enough in Chriſt to purchaſe a pardon, and prevalency in his Interceſſion to procure it, whatever your offences have been; the invitation unto Chriſt for Remiſſion and Salvation is General, none are excluded, but ſuch as exclude themſelves; the promiſes are full, Crimſon ſins, ſuch as are of the deepeſt dye, God promiſeth to make as Wool; and the promiſes are free, the acceptation of a pardon by Faith makes it yours, without any price or merit on your part. We Miniſters have a commiſſion to preach Remiſſion of ſins in the Name of Chriſt, and to declare to you the glad ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of Salvation, yea, we have inſtructions, as Embaſſadors, in the Name of God and Chriſt to beſeech you that you would be reconciled, that you would accept of forgiveneſs. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Now then we are Embaſſadors for Chriſt, as though God did beſeech you by us, we pray you in Chriſt's ſtead
<pb n="731" facs="tcp:95740:381"/> be ye reconciled unto God.</hi> Give me leave to preſs this Argument upon you: the great God of Heaven and Earth, ſo glorious in Holineſs and Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is ſo infinitely Merciful and Gracious, as to beſeech you that you would be reconciled, although you are ſo infinitely inferiour unto him. He condeſcends to intreat you, not that you would ſhew kindneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, but that you would ſhew kindneſs to your ſelves, and accept of the greateſt kindneſs at his hands of Forgiveneſs and Reconciliation. God might command, and upon once the leaſt refuſal, he might execute his vengeance upon you; but although ſome of you have ſtopped your Ears ſo long, refuſed his gracious proſfer ſo often, though you have abuſed his kindneſs, trampled upon his Patience, ſlighted his invitations, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed his threatnings, diſregarded his promiſes, and turning all his rich Grace into wantonneſs, do continue ſtill in your diſobedience; yet the Lord doth again make ſuit unto you, ſtretcheth forth his hands unto you, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever diſobedient and gain-ſaying you have been, and by me doth intreat you that you would be reconciled. Need we uſe intreaties with condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Malefactors to accept of a pardon? if we had commiſſion to preach par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning Mercy unto Devils would they need intreaties to accept? would they be fooled out of ſuch a gracious proſfer by any as you hitherto have been by them? Sinners I beſeech you in the name of the great and glorious <hi>Jehovah,</hi> and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt your gracious Redeemer that you would be reconciled, and that you would befriend your ſelves and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of the forgiveneſs of all your ſins, I intreat you that you would not through neglect of pardon and perſeverance in a ſinful courſe ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recoverably ruine and damn your Souls; methinks my heart doth yearn over you, and Bleed for you who are wounding your ſelves and ruſhing on inconſiderately towards the place of everlaſting weeping and wo, from whence there is no coming back, no coming out for ever. Sinners, why ſhould you be ſo hard to be perſwaded, without any further delay, to be reconciled unto God? Why do I need to uſe ſo many intreaties? May I at length prevail with you that you would not be miſerable, and prove your own Murderers; that you would be bleſſed here and hereafter, through your ready acceptation of pardoning mercy. What anſwer muſt I carry back to my Maſter who ſent me this day to proclaim in your ears the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs of forgiveneſs, and to uſe intreaties with you in his name that you would become thus bleſſed? Muſt I complain? <hi>Lord, there are a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of obſtinate ſinners whom I have intreated to accept of pardon; but there is not the leaſt ſpark of ingenuity amongſt them; nor the leaſt ſenſe of their ſins upon them; had I been to preach to Beaſts, or Fowls, to the Earth or Stones, they would have been as much moved as theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; Lord, I ſpent my ſtrength and pains, my voice and lungs for nought, I know not how to perſwade; I know not which way to prevail with them; I thought thy beſeechings would have taken with them; that the intreaties of God, like a ſweet flame, would have melted their hearts as Wax within them; I thought that when thou didſt vouchſafe by me to requeſt them to leave their ſins, and be reconciled unto thee, that this would marvellouſly have affected them, and that they would readily have
<pb n="732" facs="tcp:95740:382"/> complied in a thing ſo neceſſary for them, and ſo much for their own happineſs: I did begin with terror to them, and yet they were not affrighted; but I hoped when I came to end with Mercy and to ſpeak in the ſoft and ſweet Language of thine en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, and to urge th s moſt winning Argument of thy Requeſts unto them, that then they would immediately have yielded, and moſt thankfully have accepted ſo gracious proffers made unto them; But alas, Lord, I found it far otherwiſe than I expected; if their ears were open, their hearts were ſhut up, and they would not receive my meſſage, which from thee in faithfulneſs and tenderneſs I delivered unto them; And what may I farther hope will prevail with them, if thy intreaties be thus diſregarded?</hi> Muſt I thus complain, or may I have occaſion to ſay; <hi>Lord, I have been preaching the bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs, which I backed with thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties of ſinners that they would accept of it; and through thy bleſſing, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments I uſed, were not altogether in vain; ſome ſinners that had ſtouted it out a long time againſt thee, began at length to relent and yield, when they heard thine intreaties of them to be reconciled: Lord, I heard ſcalding ſighs break forth from ſuch and ſuch, whoſe hearts were breaking within them for their ſins; I ſaw briniſh tears trickling down from ſome eyes, proceeding from a ſpring of godly ſorrow with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, newly given them by the Spirit; how did they look, and ſeem to long after thy Salvation? how greedily did they hearken, even like the condemned Malefactor, when he hath firſt tidings of a pardon? I hope they are gone home to intreat that of thee, which thou haſt by me been intreating of them to accept of; O Lord, grant them their deſires; be reconciled to that Drunkard and unclean wretch; forgive the iniquities of that Swearer, Sabbath-breaker and profane Sinner.</hi> What do you ſay Sinners? will you ſend me back to my Maſter ſadned or rejoyced? Accept of my Meſſage, and it will be the joy of my heart; yea, it will be the joy of Angels in Heaven; and however it will coſt you ſome grief and tears in your repentance of ſin at the firſt, yet if you ſo ſeek after this bleſſedneſs of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, as to obtain it, the iſſue will be joy to your ſelves, you will have the beginnings of joy here, and in the other world your joys will be full, ineffable, and eternal. Methinks ſome of you ſeem almoſt perſwaded; O that you were quite perſwaded without further delay, to put in practice the Directions given for the obtaining the bleſſedneſs of forgiveneſs!</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Context tells us, that the Apoſtle was now at <hi>Miletus,</hi> v. 17. and from hence he ſends to <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and calls for the Elders of the Church. Now theſe Elders were not <hi>Timothy</hi> and <hi>Trophimus;</hi> for they were in his company already, <hi>v.</hi> 4. and had been with him in his journey hither; but rather thoſe twelve men on whom he laid his hands, and beſtowed the Holy Ghoſt, in order to their Miniſtry at <hi>Epheſus,</hi> Acts 19.1, 2, 6, 7. and the reſt whom <hi>Timothy</hi> had ordained whilſt he was there.</p>
            <p>From <hi>v.</hi> 18. of this Chapter, we have the Apoſtle's Farewel Sermon; wherein he clears himſelf by cloſe and ſmart addreſſes to their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Experiences, as to all charges and ſurmiſes of miniſterial miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carriages among them, <hi>v.</hi> 18.27. and works them all within the Conſcience of their miniſterial charge and truſt from God, to imitate his Miniſterial faithfulneſs, by urging ſuch ſignificant and cogent Arguments, as were apt and proper to ſtartle and engage them to and in their work. And theſe Arguments are drawn from the preſent and inſtantly ſucceeding circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances and concernments of the Church of God. They were in danger of Wolves breaking in upon them, and ſeducers ariſing from amongſt them: They were the Church of God, the price of his Blood, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the care and guidance of theſe Miniſters, to whom the Apoſtle ſpake; and therefore the intereſt and worth of Souls, and their relation to them, and all thoſe ſad and dangerous exerciſes, underminings and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions which they were ſure to meet with in their Paſtoral work, did call aloud upon them for all poſſible circumſpection, activity and reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution
<pb n="734" facs="tcp:95740:383"/> in and for their work; of all which, the Apoſtle was an exemplary and awakening inſtance and example.</p>
            <p>My Text is the Generous Heroiciſm of an awakened and prepared heart, occaſioned by the Tidings that were brought him by the Spirit, <hi>v.</hi> 23. Who told him there, that bonds and afflictions did abide him in every City. Here you may ſee thoſe ſinews cut of hopes and fears, which might obſtruct his Faith, Diligence and Perſeverance; he is mortified to all that love of Life, and fear of Death, which poſſibly might controll his better proſpect, hopes and work.</p>
            <p>In the Words we have the Apoſtle concerned in reference to a double ſtate.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As to this mortal Life; it is implied in the Text, and expreſs'd in the Context, that it is a Theater of ſmart contentions and miſeries, and that he was concerned in the agoniſtical exerciſes thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the other Life, he had the proſpect of tranſcendent joys, exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to his views and hopes, as the determined and propoſed reward of his well-managed exerciſes; the influences and impreſſions whereof did ſtrangely invigorate and fix his reſolutions to maintain ſuch a Maſculine frame of ſpirit, as ſhould entertain and anſwer all the challenges of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, difficulties and temptations, and to preſerve that neceſſary liberty from, and uſeful indifferency to the hopes and love of Life, and fears of Death and Danger, which might ſecure the ſpirit and proweſs of a reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and ſucceſsful valour: <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I make no reckoning of any thing,</hi> and he grows regardleſs of his life, and hath mortified the vigour of all the arguments and inducements that can be fetcht therefrom; for the utmoſt reach of rage and villany is to effect no more, and can extend no farther than the loſs of Life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.28. And all thoſe Comforts, which are liable to the caſualties and ſequeſtrations of tranſient time, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not run parallel with our capacious ſouls beyond the limits of a dying breath, cannot be valued beyond the value of their end; and therefore he that conquers and ſubdues the eſtimation of his Life, hath ſo far over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come all the diſturbing and enſnaring influences of hopes and fears rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to it, and derived from it.</p>
            <p>Well, we have here an inſtance and example (in this great and gracious Apoſtle) of a reſolved and proficient Chriſtian; yea, and a viſible pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical demonſtration of what Blood and Spirits are in the veins of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and are bred there, and what an energy and force there is in one right believing look and glance at things to come, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 18. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. And if it be objected, that as the Apoſtles courſe was miniſterial, ſo were his joys which fix'd his eye; and therefore in neither can he be propoſed to others as their imitable pattern or exact encouragement, ſeeing all are not Miniſters, neither can all expect his Exerciſes, Furniture, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Attainments, and ſo that we pluck not the fruit from the right tree.</p>
            <p>I anſwer. This doth not prevent his being our pattern, argument and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement, if but theſe few things be ſeriouſly conſidered.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="735" facs="tcp:95740:383"/>1. The Apoſtle had a double Courſe to run; he had the truſt and buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of a Chriſtian, as well as of a Miniſter to diſcharge; he had a God to pleaſe, a Soul to ſave, an Hell to eſcape, an Heaven to reach, an Heart to cleanſe, and Sins to mortifie, unruly Paſſions and impetuous Affections to be curbed and managed by their proper Diſcipline, as well as others; he was a man ſubject to like Paſſions with our ſelves; he dwelt in fleſh, and was oppoſed by the Devil as well as others; he had Corruptions to be mortified and pardoned; and loved his Life, and what might make it comfortable, ſaving where Inordinacies were to be corrected and ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe of inconſiſtency with better work and joys; yea, he had ſuch forcible inclinations to deſire and beg ſome intermiſſions of, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpite from his tedious Exerciſes, as forced him to repair to Prayer and Arguments to get ſupport, ſo that he might not <hi>Oneri ſuccumbere;</hi> and thus I underſtand that <hi>Thorn in the fleſh,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7, 10. And ſo the Senſe ſeems facil, and it amounts to this; The Apoſtle had been labouring in the fire for God, and for the intereſt of Chriſtianity, and managed all his Exerciſes in the face of danger; and growing aged, he was tempted to deſire of God, that he might ſpend the reſidue of his declining age in liberty and quietneſs; but when the fleſh (ſo weather-beaten by the ſtorms) grew ſo deſirous of ſome reſpite from the ſeverity of Travel, Chains and Labours, the meſſenger Satan comes again threatning and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainting him with deſigned and determined repetitions of former Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fetings, and the renewals of Reproaches, Neceſſities, Perſecutions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for Chriſt's ſake: Which, when he underſtood, and apprehended that Chriſt and his Goſpel were ſo concerned in them, he thought (and took them as) the matter of his Glory, in that they might be ſerviceable to the Intereſt of Chriſt, and great occaſions of ſome ſpecial Illuſtrations of the remarkable Power and Grace of Chriſt; but this <hi>pace aliorum.</hi> The truth is, Sirs, he had ſuch Exerciſes and Temptations, as that (had not the expectations and perſwaſions of theſe joys above, which ſucceeded the Courſe well finiſhed; interpoſed to fortifie and compoſe his ſpirit) this world had never been conquered, nor ſo eaſily forſaken and diſclaimed by him; nor Death ſo tamely entertained, nor Hopes and Fears ſo mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged and ſubordinated as they were, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.19, 31, 32, 58. Now thus far he ſtands on equal grounds with other Chriſtians, and hath the ſame Exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, Arguments, Encouragements, Intereſt and Obligations, that every Chriſtian hath; and if it was poſſible for him to finiſh his courſe under the powerful Influences of this Proſpect and Deſign, it is as poſſible for us; for no impoſſibility, whilſt ſuch, can be our duty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. His Miniſterial Work and Truſt was (as to its full diſcharge) a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and eſſential part of his ſaving Chriſtianity. No Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt by office, can be a ſound and faithful Chriſtian, that is unfaithful in his Miniſtry; it is in ſo doing, that he muſt <hi>ſave himſelf</hi> as well as <hi>thoſe that hear him,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.15, 16.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Our accommodations being made anſwerable to Truſt and Work, our faithful management thereof is of equal neceſſity in much or little; for we muſt be anſwerable to Relations, Truſt and Places, and other Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:95740:384"/> as God hath placed us in and under them; for we muſt be judged, and are to act accordingly to what we have received. No man is comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded and encouraged faithfully to diſcharge his Miniſtry, but upon ſome ſuppoſition that the <hi>Miniſtry</hi> is his lawful Calling; and where that is, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithfulneſs will damn him that is guilty of it; for it is his place of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, even as faithful ſervice of all Servants in general is their Duty: Yet places of Service, and the matter and meaſure of their ſervice may be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent, according to the maſter's pleaſure and affairs.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The cloſe connection of his whole Courſe and Comforts clears the Caſe. For, 1. It is not imaginable that any man can be a faithful Miniſter, whoſe heart is alienated from the true powerful Principles, Sentiments and Impreſſions of Chriſtianity. For how can any man be ſeparated cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dially to this moſt coſtly painful Calling, and regularly bear the heat and burden of his Place and Day, who hath not well concocted the Subſtance, Evidence and Importance of this <hi>great Myſtery of Salvation</hi> (which is the indiſpenſable and adequate exerciſe of his Function) into deep perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, warm affections, and moſt unconquerable reſolutions? Who can unweariedly purſue the Souls of others with cloſe and preſſing importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities to prize and proſecute that Element and State of Joys and Holineſs, which is not credited, reliſhed and valued by himſelf? And further, 2. Were it ſuppoſed alſo that the regular faithfulneſs of a Miniſter was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable from the ſpirit &amp; faithfulneſs of a Chriſtian either in themſelves, or in the Subject, yet how can we imagine ſuch operative influential ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions and true reliſhes of the joy reported and propoſed, as ſhall prevail againſt all oppoſitions and diſcouragements and competitions from the frowns and flatteries, bribes and ſtroaks of Earth and Hell, to ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate a Miniſter's breſt, ſo as to make him through in all the Enterprizes and Employments of his Function, whil'ſt his own Work and Intereſt, as a Chriſtian, is neglected, and thoſe influences of this joy (entailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a courſe well finiſhed) though they be powerful to make him faithful in the one, ſhall yet be found too languid to iſſue in the ſame diligence and ſucceſs as to the other? And, 3. We muſt conclude, that this Eagle-eyed Apoſtle ſaw and reckoned on it, that a Chriſtian Miniſter and an Apoſtle, muſt be a through-Chriſtian, and ſomething, yea, much more, or elſe he could not poſſibly conclude, his Courſe would bring him to his Joys, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.24, 27. Therefore the Senſe and Errand of the Text amounts to this;</p>
            <p>Doctr. <hi>That the comforts of a well compleated courſe will make all diſcerning ſerious Chriſtians to be above the regard of Life, or fear of all afflictions, bonds or death to compaſs them.</hi> Rom. 8.18. <hi>and</hi> Phil. 1.20.23.</p>
            <p>The very inſtance, argument, and errand of my Text, and Doctrine grounded thereupon, imply and include ſeveral things, as that, 1. there is a ſtate of future joys and retributions, for we have no reaſon to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine that our Apoſtle was ſo blind as to be deceived himſelf: nor ſo wicked

No man that knows and credits the exiſtence of a Deity, but he muſt take him to be the ſtrongeſt, wiſeſt, &amp; the beſt of beings, and ſo that he muſt needs be omnipotent, omniſcient, and all-ſufficient, and if ſo, then it is beyond all controveſie, that omnipotence can at ſuch a rate addreſs it ſelf to Creatures, as to make them happy or miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as it beſt becomes it ſelf. He that ordained and framed this ſtate can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be thought to have acted to the utmoſt of his ſtrength, for what can ſtint omnipotence? and doth it ſuit the wiſdom of God, to make a Creature capable of an everlaſting ſtate, and of the hopes and proſpect of it, and to implant in it an expectation of it, and rule him by thoſe hopes and fears which do and muſt derive their influences from an eternal ſtate, and after all to make it evident, that man was only made to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed on, or ruled and managed by miſtakes and meer fallacious argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and errours? or hath God afforded us the leaſt intimation of his mind, in nature, providence or ſcriptures, that this is the way of conci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liating that love and honour from his Subjects, or of implanting and maintaining thoſe neceſſary fears in man, which government requires for the attainments of its ends, to make them live in expectation of what is no ways fit to reach its ends, becauſe it is either falſe or mean? and therefore I need not go about to prove what here is granted and impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and what ſo many incomparably better pens have proved before me. 2. this ſtate hath ſufficient force as to argument and motive to preſs us to do and ſuffer all that we can meet with or be called to in our whole Chriſtian courſe. All thoſe ſevere perplexities which our religion calls us to, as to obedience in ſufferings and duty, are not beyond the compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of theſe approaching expected joys: and if they obſtruct the influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and eclips the light and glory of what is propoſed and promiſed as our great argument and encouragement, 'tis utterly &amp; only our own fault that makes what is ſufficient to be ineffectual. 3. The comforts of a courſe well finiſhed cannot be had without the regular management &amp; finiſhing of our courſe, &amp; this can never be without reſolution and preparation of the heart, by which it muſt be born and kept above immoderate love to life and fear of ſufferings and death. Faith is the ſpirit of religion: the ſpirit of faith is hope; and the ſpirit of hope is love; and theſe are all the moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful preparations of the heart. Had faith its liberty, power and proſpect in the heart of all profeſſors, it would make them too ſagacious &amp; concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be impoſed on by plauſible deluſions, and bold pretences in all theſe ſublunary trifles, to that ſubſtantial ſolid ſatisfaction and excellency, which are expected by ductile mortals to be experienced therein, or hoped for therefrom. Did we but look beyond the grave and wilderneſs, and ſearch and ſee that land of promiſe which is beyond them, we might be entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and allured with ſuch cluſters from it, as would afford us more grateful reliſhes and ſpirits, than all the feculent extractions of theſe tranſient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts could amount to. All our delights and pleaſures in, and great ſollici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes about theſe lower things would be effectually mortified and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. what breaſts of conſolation are evidence &amp; ſubſtance? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. ſenſe and preſence do ſtrangely invigorate &amp; ſtrengthen the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous

And becauſe the gain and comforts of true Religion are inviſible and diſtant, therefore their certainty and tranſcendent excellency muſt be concocted into deep and ſound Perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and be digeſted into anſwerable Affections, Reſolutions and Purſuit; and all thoſe Arguments and Motives which muſt prevail upon us to run and finiſh the courſe and race which is ſet before us, muſt be derived from and are to be reduced to this deep perſwaſion of theſe certain and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendent comforts, nor is it poſſible that Religion ſhould live or thrive but in the power of and true proportion to our apprehenſions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions of thoſe fundamental truths and principles of God's exiſtence and rewarding excellency, <hi>Heb.</hi> 16.6 Man muſt be ruled as God hath made him, and as fear and love are the commanding paſſions and affections of every ſubject capable of moral government, ſo ſomething there muſt be reported and determined, fit for the exerciſe and diſcipline thereof, and if tranſcendency, in what muſt influence, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I make the matter of this joy to be the Soul's adequate End and Object, which none but God can be; ſince it is apparent that neither Heaven nor Earth have any beſides God to make and be a portion for the Soul, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25. And then, 6. I lay the formality of this joy in the poſſeſſion and embraces of this End and Object, both as adequate and deſired; for as it is adequate, it ſpeaks no want nor deficiency in the Object; and as it is deſired, ſo it ſpeaks the preparation of the Subject; and as it is embraced and poſſeſs'd, ſo it ſpeaks no coſt and labours loſt, nor expectations fruſtrated. And now indeed the Soul is moſt raviſhed, when all its motions are directed to their End, and terminated there, with unconceivable ſatisfaction, when God is all in all, and the poor painful Chriſtian is, through tedious oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, difficulties and travels, ſafely conducted to its moſt proper Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Choice and Joy.</p>

            <p n="3">3.

            <p>Query 2. <hi>How far muſt love to Life be conquered and ſubdued, and every thing be diſregarded, for the right finiſhing of our courſe with joy?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Theſe things muſt be diſtinguiſhed, in order to the underſtanding of the Nature and Meaſure of this Duty and Attainment.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is one thing what may be loved and valued ſimply and abſtracted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as only conſidered in it ſelf; and 'tis another thing what may be loved and valued, as compared with ſomething elſe. And,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is one thing what degree of value of Love and Care may ſuit the excellency and importance of the Object, and another thing what may exceed it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is one thing how I may love a thing, when conſiſtent with, and conducing to our beſt Concernment; and 'tis another thing how I may love what is withdrawn from and ſet againſt it. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is one thing to have Affections to be Snares and Hindrances, and another thing to have them Helps and Furtherances to ſomething bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And,</p>
            <p n="5">5. A moderate and ſubordinate love is one thing, and a ſupreme and co-ordinate love is another. And,</p>
            <p n="6">6. It is one thing to love with true ſubmiſſion to God's commanding and diſpoſing Will, and another thing to love to the prejudice of God's Prerogative and Providence; ſo as to murmur and quarrel with the great <hi>Jehovah</hi> for what he doth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. And upon theſe Diſtinctions may we ground theſe following Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions and Concluſions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Life and the Comforts of it are eligible and deſirable as they are conſidered in themſelves; and in this ſenſe God hath not forbidden the loving of them. They come from God as emanations and expreſſions of his Goodneſs: They are <hi>good and perfect gifts,</hi> and lovely in their kind and plaees; for had not Life been lovely, it could have been no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to dye; for all puniſhment is <hi>Malum Phyſicum propter Malum Morale;</hi> and when it is laid in a privation, the want cannot be evil, if the thing we are deprived of be not good and lovely; nor could the promiſe of long life have been a quickning Argument to Holineſs and Duty (as it is, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.10, 11. <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.12.) had we not loved it. Nor would God have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to us as a Mercy, what is not good and lovely. <hi>Adam</hi> in Innocence had the love of Life implanted in him; &amp; he did ill in that he feared the loſs of
<pb n="742" facs="tcp:95740:387"/> Life too little, to make him regularly careful to preſerve it. And it had been no argument of awful cogency that he ſhould dye upon tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, had not the love of Life been deeply rooted and implanted in him; for who can rationally fear the loſs of what he cares not for? It is plain that <hi>Adam</hi>'s love to Life was the reſult of God's Creation, and therefore good; for it was in him in his Innocence: And the Argument was framed to prevent Tranſgreſſion, as ſomething poſſible, but not yet exiſtent; and God was never angry with him, till he through ſin had forfeited his Life; and this proved his love to Life to be every way conſiſtent with a ſtate of Innocence. And for all the Comforts of Life, they are deſirable in themſelves, and lovely: As, <hi>Relation, Eph.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Liberty,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. and <hi>Birth-priviledges Acts</hi> 22.28. <hi>Credit, Prov.</hi> 22.1. <hi>Outward Supplies, Prov.</hi> 30.8 Yea, <hi>Plenty of them, Eccl.</hi> 7.11. &amp; 10.10. And it is impoſſible and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane for any man ſimply to deſire and attempt his own perſonal Miſery and Deſtruction; yea, it is his ſin to do it. See <hi>Acts</hi> 26.29. Neither doth Grace it ſelf mortifie or correct our love to Life and all its Comforts, as ſimply conſidered in themſelves; for if it did, it could neither be the trial nor the commendation of a gracious ſober Chriſtian to part with Life and Comforts, ſince it would only be demanding from him what he cared not for, <hi>Gen</hi> 22.1 2, 12.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Life and the Comforts of it have their ſubſerviency to better things; and thus it is more our Duty not to diſregard them. Life makes us capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of ſerving God, and of the enjoyment of him. Our ſpiritual and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life ſuppoſe; natural Life: and further, 'tis our ſtate of uſefulneſs and trial. We cannot actually ſerve God any further, or our Generation longer, than we have our Lives and Beings here. The uſefulneſs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts of Relations are reciprocal. How can I ſee or ſerve God with what I have not? They are my helps, and truſt and trials. Relations may be mutually won and ripened for eternal Glory by <hi>each others Converſation,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. Credit is valuable becauſe of uſefulneſs to others, and our own neceſſary confidences and encouragements, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.7. Places of Honour and important Truſt muſt not be diſregarded. <hi>Joſeph, Mordecai</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were greatly ſerviceable through their great intereſt and eſtimation in their reſpective Princes Courts. What uſeful Inſtruments have holy Kings and Princes been for God upon their Thrones? Plenty and fulneſs are deſirable: <hi>'Tis better to give than to receive, Acts</hi> 20.35. <hi>Innocence</hi> and <hi>Independence</hi> ſteel the Countenance. 'Tis comfortable to be the poor man's ſtaff, and the rich man's pattern. The like I may ſay of Liberty, Gifts, Parts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when God throws theſe things upon us, to make us uſeful, it would be our miſery, ſhame and ſin to caſt them from us with contempt; and as both <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> ſtand in relation to <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> Grace rather heightens than abates eſteem and value of them; and rather quickens and engages <hi>thankfulneſs</hi> and <hi>affections</hi> for and to them, than ſets the heart againſt them thus conſidered.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is the Apoſtaſie of our ſtate and hearts from God, that ſets our lives and comforts in their capacity of being ſnares to us. Had it not been for ſin, God, and our Lives and Comforts had not been reduced to
<pb n="743" facs="tcp:95740:387"/> ſuch an inconſiſtency as now they are; nor had our <hi>natural Lives</hi> and <hi>Comforts</hi> been our ſnares, had not their end and ours been changed: they had never been ſo inſignificant, as to our ſafety and delight, had we not torn them from that their Figure, God himſelf, to whom their true ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate relation gave them their whole worth and value. Our ſnares and ſurfeits come from our own irregular appetites, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.9, 10. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34. Life and its Conſolations are God's, and good, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.17. The Luſt is ours, 1 <hi>John</hi> 2.16.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Life and all things muſt be diſregarded, as they are ſeparate from God, and ſet againſt him; as they are ſeparated from God, ſo they muſt be neglected; and as they are ſet againſt God, ſo they muſt be oppoſed. Our lives muſt never be a <hi>courſe of luſts, Rom.</hi> 13.13. Nor muſt their Comforts and Continuance be entertained or indulged, as God's Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents or Corrivals; nor be preſerved, poſſeſt or proſecuted to the prejudice of better things, even holy works and joy; while they and better things may keep together, the elder muſt ſerve the younger. Our preſent Life and Comforts muſt miniſter to the great Concernments of another better ſtate; and when <hi>Religion</hi> or our <hi>Lives</hi> muſt go, we muſt diſclaim the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to ſecure the former. Nothing muſt bound or circumvent <hi>Religion;</hi> nor muſt it be ſubjected to the trifling ends and dotages of a tranſient Life.

            <p>Query 4 and the Caſe in hand. <hi>What muſt we therefore do to (and how muſt we) overcome the inordinate Love of Life and Fear of Death?</hi> For no man can love or dare to dye, that loves this Life inordinately; and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lues it too dear to let it go; or that prevailingly doubts, or fears, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervalues a better Life hereafter. Now in this inſtance in my Text, Bonds and Afflictions ſeemed to miniſter to Death; and Death is very terrible to Nature, as its Diſſolution, and terrible to intereſted Souls in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernments of this Life, as ending all the Pleaſures, Profits, Honors that Senſe &amp; Fancy can be courted with; 'tis terrible to thoſe that are not ſatisfied of another ſtate, becauſe it ends what they were ſure of the exiſtence of, and had the greateſt deſires of, and pleaſures in; and becauſe it uſhers them thither where their doubt will be reſolved, and that for ought they know (and they have great jealouſies and ſuſpicions of it in ſober thoughts and cool blood) to their eternal ſorrow, coſt and ſhame. 'Tis terrible to thoſe that never valued the joys, and hopes and work of Godlineſs, and cannot then expect the recompences of that Godlineſs which they decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="745" facs="tcp:95740:388"/> and hated. And it is terrible to thoſe that are uncertain, as to their ſpiritual ſtate, dark in their evidences, low in their hopes, and diſturbed with melancholick or other fears about their intereſt in God and Chriſt, and everlaſting welfare of their immortal Souls. So that where all or any of theſe things prevail, men dread to leave this Life, and to be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to another ſtate by Death, be it natural or violent. And the ſame Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, Helps and Motives that may be uſeful for the one, may be alſo uſeful for the other; and therefore before the Caſe can be reſolved, ſomething muſt be premiſed to prepare the way; and that is this: <hi>viz.</hi> The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Text is a ſucceſsful proper Antidote againſt a double evil, and it is the ground and meaſure of a neceſſary Duty. 1. The Evils are, the inordinate love of Life, and the fear of Bonds, Afflictions, Death. 2. The Argument imports, 1. A proſpect of ſomething better than what we are called to mortifie, feel or quit, and that is joy reſulting from a Courſe well finiſhed; and a ſtate (if I may call it ſo) of meer non-exiſtence cannot deſerve or claim the name of Joy, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.17, 29, 32. And nothing but this proſpect could neceſſitate his ſufferings, or his diſregard of Life; nor could this do it, had he not ſure foundations for his Confidence, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 1.10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. And therefore the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect mortifies the inordinate fear of Death. Now, 2. The Argument imports a Project too; and that is this: <hi>viz.</hi> ſo to manage and compleat the Courſe, as to ſecure the Joy; which cannot be, if Life or any thing have an equal or tranſcendent intereſt in us or influence upon us; and therefore the neceſſary Duty is the Conqueſt of the Love of Life, and Fear of Death. The meaſure of our neceſſary Conqueſt is fetcht from its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and ſubſerviency to the Prize; So far as Love of Life and Fear of Death are oppoſed to, and inconſiſtent with our better hopes and work, ſo far they muſt be overcome. And the ground of the Duty is in the Text; becauſe otherwiſe our Courſe cannot be finiſhed with joy; it can be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther regular nor ſucceſsful without the conqueſt and attainment of my Text: And therefore my Anſwer to the Caſe before us, ſhall lie in theſe few following Directions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Be throughly perſwaded of, and heartily affected with a Life to come, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17, 18. This is the poyſe and <hi>pondus</hi> of Religion. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6. This is the heart and ſtrength of Godlineſs. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.14, 26. 'Tis this that ſtrips that King of Terrors, Death, of all his frightful looks and ſtrength.

It was this that did invigorate the confidence and courage of that Noble Army of Martyrs, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. throughout. This cloaths the Brow with Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, to face the ſtorms, and entertain the challenges of Earth and Hell. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.35, 39 This ſtartles hearty Reſolutions into awakened Exerciſes; &amp; forceth ſuch expreſſions of inward ſtrength and fixedneſs, as ſhall amaze the world, and ſhame the daring ſtupid Infidel into ſtrange Convictions of the tranſcendent joys &amp; gain of godlineſs, and its approaching triumphs. This makes the heart indifferent to live or dye, ſo that by either the great concernment may be proſperous and ſucceſsful, and need I furniſh you
<pb n="746" facs="tcp:95740:389"/> with arguments to perſwade you to believe another ſtate? doth not the word of God, the ſoul of man, the courſe and conſequence of moral go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment paſs into arguments to prove this thing? would God create capacity in the <hi>ſoul of man</hi> to render him proper for another ſtate, and do this, as the reſult of his remarkable love and wiſdom, and make him capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of being influenced by motives drawn from hence, and after all turn his capacity into his <hi>wrack,</hi> and <hi>abuſe</hi> and rule him by <hi>miſtakes</hi> and <hi>er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours,</hi> and ſhame thoſe hope; and confidences in the <hi>Soul,</hi> and ſtrip it of thoſe proper ends and exerciſes, which God himſelf ordained, enjoined and ſtarted? Moreover, will not the ſtate and element of everlaſting re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions be more ſignificant than a probationary ſtate and theatre? and if ſo, no way more proper to conquer the inordinacy in our caſe, than right perſwaſions and reſentments of <hi>another ſtate of life.</hi> It is no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that an <hi>Infidel</hi> ſhould be inordinate in his love of life, for he that looks for nothing when he is dead, cannot attempt divorcement from his <hi>Idols, intereſt</hi> and <hi>conſolations</hi> here; for now he muſt conclude, <hi>that a living dog is better then a dead man;</hi> and if the ſmart conviction will not ſuffer him to remain an <hi>Infidel</hi> (for <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi> cannot be ſuch, without his permiſſion, if not judicial ſtupefaction and deſertion by whom they were created) yet if he reliſh not the joys and exerciſes of another ſtate hereafter, he cannot but be wanton and impoſed upon by his enſnaring dreams and ſhadows, and parcel out his heart (till he have loſt himſelf) amongſt the incoherent tranſient vanities of <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>fancy.</hi> The world and preſent life are this mans all: and 'tis no wonder if when he hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe on which he can place his heart, he fix it here; but oh when better things appear in chaſe and view, when things commenſurate with his capacity and duration ſtrike his concerned eye with cloſe and ſmart appulſes, and ſo affects his heart, ſhadows muſt fly away, and the Sons of the Morning muſt ſuit their exerciſes and attempts to the diſcoveries of their day, and alienate their hearts from what will be abuſive of their ſouls and hopes; as their <hi>diſcoveries</hi> will make them then conclude.</p>

Your life is but a ſhadow which muſt diſappear, a cloud that muſt be ſcattered, more eaſily paſſed through than embraced, and all the <hi>glory</hi> of this <hi>World</hi> is eaſily winked into blackneſs and diſtaſte, and all the lower comforts of our lives are but the crums we gather from the bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken world. The world it ſelf is but an <hi>Element</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> and through that curſe upon it, which was derived by our <hi>firſt apoſtacy,</hi> it is become a <hi>ſtormy</hi> and <hi>diſturbed Region.</hi> There is nothing ſuitable to our better part therein when ſeparate from God and ſet againſt him. Our <hi>Souls</hi> (the nobleſt part of Man) are entertained with nothing but burthens, ſtints and ſnares. A chain of <hi>Gold</hi> may pinch as hard as one of <hi>Iron.</hi> There is nothing here that can endure thoſe warm affections and cloſe embraces which our true happineſs deſerves; and ſhould we thus embrace them, our Idols arms and hearts would certainly be broken altogether. Our lawful comforts and delights are hereby embittered and polluted, and melt away
<pb n="747" facs="tcp:95740:389"/> to nothing, and bid farewel with dreadful gripes and bitter reliſhes, and fly away upon the wings we give them, for indeed the great affections of our enflamed hearts cannot but turn them all to ſmoak. It is their ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent uſefulneſs and relation to God, our preſent work, and future glory that make and ſpeak them excellent, and if you change their <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, you rob the cluſter of its beſt juice and bleſſing: and if your lives and comforts turn God's competitors and enemies, you Spin them into ſnares and ruines. And were but this the rule and meaſure of all our fears and love, there would be joy in keeping and reſigning them; God would be with them in their ſtay, and in their ſtead and places when they are gone; in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.24, 26. Oh! how diſgracefully is this world reflected on in holy Writ? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 6, 19, 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. And when you do compare it with that above, and caſt them both into an equal balance in your conſiderate and ſerious thoughts and pauſes, then think which is nobleſt in its nature, moſt indiſturbed in its poſſeſſions, moſt uniform in its conſtitution, moſt enduring in its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, moſt adequate in its proportions, and moſt deſirable in its full dimenſions, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. And what advantages herein are others teſtimonies in the Caſe! Would you but meaſure the good and evil of both worlds by the experiences and apprehenſions of dying and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened perſons, how vaſt a difference would you ſee betwixt the life and comforts of them both; yea, and their ſorrows too! Where have you any thing in this world that can preponderate or equal the comforts of God's bleſſed Face and Favour? eſpecially when all clouds and frowns are gone? what is this world more apt to do, than to deface God's Image in us, (or prevent it) darken his Glory, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct his comfortable emanations and addreſſes to us, and to foment our Jealouſies and ſuſpitions about his preſent intereſt in us, and his eternal kindneſs to us? O what a difference is there betwixt the mantle of our mortal life, which falls upon that dark and ſluggiſh world where purblind man delights to be, and thoſe more glorious and enduring <hi>Robes of Righteouſneſs, Salvation, Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Immortality</hi> which our Redeemer hath provided for us, where by our death he calls and takes us?

We muſt not dream of being always on the Stage; we have our parts to act, our work to do, and muſt be called off ere long, that others may ſucceed us; and after a few ſucceſſive Acts, the Theatre muſt be taken down, and can we

What! hath God ſent us hither to doat upon thoſe Lives and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts which are built upon the weak, uncertain Sands, and ſpend themſelves in triflings upon the haſty ſtreams of ſhort uncertain Time? Or is it not rather that we ſhould be acting and ripening for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal joys and exerciſes? This is our time of Diſcipline, Exerciſe and education for the Prince's Court, to fit us for our everlaſting Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations before the great <hi>Jehovah.</hi> Now we are learning Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and labouring to underſtand and try what it is to love and honour God; what to be ruled and taught, that ſo we might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by Chriſt, to thrive upon and under preparatory quicknings, counſels and conſolations of the Spirit, what it is to receive, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, refract God's Holineſs and Image in his inſtituted ways and methods; and can we terminate our Affections, Pleaſures and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires upon theſe preliminary elements and preluſions to thoſe more lof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Exerciſes and enjoyments that wait for us when we have regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly finiſhed our probationary Courſe? Surely our dark diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, ſlender attainments, cold affections, frequent and great diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, and faint attempts to get near God, our mean proficiency, and the true proſpect of what we want, as to both our accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and enjoyments, ſhould make us eaſily reſolve our value, care and love into this one ſingle aim and enterprize; namely, to ſee that Comforts, Lives and Time be moſt effectually managed and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved for the ſecuring of theſe joys before us; for there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that we are and have below, but it is a Talent for the Market, not the Napkin: and therefore neither Life nor Comforts ſhould lie as dead Goods upon our hands, nor be as Idols in our hearts. Have we but one thing needful to ſecure, and are we upon our tryal for it? and ſhall we turn our truſt and helps to ſnares and hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rances, by doating on them; and by fixing and abiding, where we ſhould be in motion? Are not we called to labour in the Vineyard, in order to our reckoning and reward at night? and is it not to day that we muſt work? <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.12, 15. <hi>John</hi> 17.4.5, Will not our Crop and Harveſt be anſwerable to our Seed? <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.7, 9. What wonder is it that the guilty Drone ſo much deſires to live, and fears to die, or that he rages, frets and trembles to hear his Hour and the Judge is come? When men have trifled all the day, 'tis a moſt frightful ſight to ſee the lengthned ſhadow and declining Sun. Stupefaction is no conqueſt of the fear of Death, or love of Life: But when the awakened ſoul expects and ſees the King of Terrors in the head of his whole Army, and on his haſty March, what then can ſteell that countenance, whoſe heart and life have been expended and embezled in trifling dotages and miſtakes; yea, and groſs neglects of what the man was ſent into the world to do? He that was ſent into the world to pleaſe his God, and ſave his Soul, and to grapple with, and trample on the twiſted ſtrength and ſubtilties of Earth and Hell, and to acorn and propagate Religion by an exact and exemplary converſation,
<pb n="749" facs="tcp:95740:390"/> and ſo under Chriſt, to make all clear within and ſure above, when he hath neglected all, cannot be comfortably furniſhed to ſacrifice or part with life for the Concernments of Eternity, with chearfulneſs, and out of choice; or to conquer the Exerciſes, Fears and Challenges of a dying hour. And beſides did we but carry as upon our trial, weaning our hearts from things below, and wedding them to things above, and managing all our Duties with all diligence and reſolution; the very oppoſitions and difficulties of the way, and of our work in this world, would make us weary of our entertainment here, and full of vehement longings and deſires to be gone. We ſhould have little heart to wiſh for long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance where we can have neither welcom nor ſatisfaction. Our very works and ſufferings would abate our love to Life; and our incumbrances about many things and from them, when they are apprehended as prejudicial to the <hi>one thing needful,</hi> would be rejected by us, becauſe diſtaſtful to us.</p>

               <hi>Propoſ.</hi> 1. There is a ſtate of Life and Immortality deſigned and prepared for holy perſons. It is prepared, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25, 34. Diſcovered, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by Chriſt, and propoſed by God, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.11.14. Promiſed, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.2. And reſerved in Heaven for ſuch, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. We have all the imaginable proofs &amp; demonſtrations of it, that things inviſible, and at a diſtance from us, can be capable of. God hath made us capable thereof, and hath implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us a deſire of, and longing for it; though ſome, through ſin, have rotted theſe deſires at the roots. And further, on theſe deſires, capacity, and inclinations, God hath grounded Laws for Moral Government, and rules the world by hopes and fear, whoſe vital influences are derived from this future ſtate. And further ſtill, God hath ſent his Son to tell us of theſe preparations, who in the humane nature publiſh'd ſuch reports, which God atteſted by frequent apparent uncontroulable Miracles, and ſealed them with his blood, and <hi>roſe again as the firſt fruits of them that ſleep;</hi> and after taught this Doctrine, and went to Heaven to take poſſeſſion, and make neceſſary preparations for our conduct thither, and title and poſſeſſion there; and ſent the Spirit down for the repeated Seals and Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lication of this Doctrine of a Life to come; who did inſpire Apoſtles to write and preach it, and urge it upon the Conſciences of men, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the heart of man for this Inheritance, to urge it as an Argument of weight upon them, and ſtart joys and ſorrows in them as they carry in relation hereunto: And he hath declared, that he will judge the world
<pb n="751" facs="tcp:95740:391"/> by Chriſt, in order to their legal ſettlement in this ſtate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 2. Our preſent ſtate of life and comforts is no way comparable to what is deſigned hereafter. It is a State and City, in reſpect where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of <hi>God is not aſhamed to be called our God, Heb.</hi> 11.16. with <hi>Luke</hi> 20.34.38. Oh what a change of perſons ſhall we meet with there! <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.49, 54. Our bodies ſhall not be what they now are; even the wracks and loads and chains of ſouls. What are they now but foul unactive lumps of Clay? they are pierced with cold, and worn with labours, appaled with griefs and dangers, and griped with pains, and macerated with keen and envious paſſions, and after all mouldred to duſt by death and rottenneſs; but there, neither deformity, pains, nor death ſhall be their fear nor exerciſe. Our Souls ſhall quit their priſons, clouds and chains; our apprehenſions ſhall be clear, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. and Conſciences full of peace and joy. Oh what an harmony and concord ſhall there be betwixt God's will and ours! what purity, order, warmth and vigour ſhall there be in our affections? and what ſubſerviency and due proſtrations in our paſſions? yea, what comfort and conſtancy ſhall there be in full and grateful exerciſes in the whole man! No Jars and Diſcords ſhall ſpoil the Melody of our Spheres; our Holineſs ſhall need no Crutch, but reach the fulneſs of a <hi>perfect ſtature;</hi> no broken-winded nor imperfect praiſes there; the pulſe of perfect Souls ſhall know no intermiſſions nor unequal motions, but keep one conſtant rate of work and joy. And what a change of ſtate, as well as perſons ſhall we meet with there? <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. A vale of tears quit for Rivers of eternal pleaſures; an element of joys ſucceeds our bitter Cups; our rights can never be invaded there; nothing can ſtain the comforts of that world; no blots nor wounds are there con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted nor endured; no troubles in that <hi>Iſrael;</hi> there are no pauſes of aſtoniſhment through ſurpriſals of afflictions; death ſmites no corners there; Providence makes no ſtorms, there lies that Ark wherein no vile or wicked <hi>Cham</hi> ſhall dwell, the glory of that place it knows no eclipſe nor cloud; no dim diſcoveries or flat notes ſhall be the exerciſe or enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of that ſtate. How ſprightly are the Airs and deſcants of their <hi>Hallelujahs.</hi> No worm on Conſcience or carkaſs there; there Charity knows no breach; no male-adminiſtrations in that Kingdom; nor bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of God's providence, or of the Actions of his ſervants there; there are no cuts from Friends, nor gripes from Enemies; no frailties to report, nor Enemies to report them; no falls in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to grate upon theſe holy hearts, nor fears to be their painful exerciſes; there are no wrinkles on the brows of God, nor frowns upon the face of Majeſty, nor one de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected look amongſt thoſe bleſſed Myriads of Saints and Angels; their Ark hath neither ſhake nor cover, nor any ſtartling ſtrokes to terrifie its at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants. Souls once arrived at this harbour, are entertained with perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in a morning-bluſh and everlaſting youthfulneſs. Oh who can draw theſe <hi>Breaſts of Conſolation</hi> dry; Theſe upper Springs they run clear and freely; and <hi>all the Fountains of the great Deep ſhall there be broken up</hi> to overflow the Banks of Paradiſe with everlaſting joys and ſatisfaction. With what a torrent ſhall theſe clear and pleaſant Rivers run? Should I
<pb n="752" facs="tcp:95740:392"/> attempt a full deſcription of this joyful ſtate, I might far ſooner ſet Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick upon the wrack, and contract the Character of being one that quaintly did attempt to play the fool, and was eloquently mad, than think to eſcape that cenſure, <hi>Job</hi> 38.2. <hi>Who is this that darkneth counſel by words without knowledge?</hi> Oh, it muſt be Viſion and Fruition, and not the Flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes of expreſſion that muſt reach the excellent perfections of that ſtate, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2 9. See <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.11. And now ſhall we fear to leave this world and die? What! ſhall we be undone by being happy? Is it the miſery of man to be with God, like him, and dear and near unto him? What is this ſtate and theatre of woes and ſorrows, that we are ſo loth to quit it? Methinks I ſee the Angels overmatcht with ſtrange aſtoniſhment at our reluctancies to be gone, and our averſeneſs to deſert our Dotages and Priſons. It might in reaſon be expected from us, that no exerciſe of our patience ſhould be ſo ſore and pinching as this, that we muſt ſtay from Heaven ſo long; and ſhall we after all, raiſe ſuch a falſe report about the Land of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by our averſeneſs to be gone thereto, as to inſinuate into the thoughts of others, that either the trifles of this mortal Life, or the pains and terrors of our paſſage to the Land of Reſt, are much beyond the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compences and Reparations that we ſhall meet with there? View then the difference, and be free to go?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Prop.</hi> 3. Death is an enemy which Chriſt hath conquered; and <hi>God hath given us the victory through Christ,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.54, 57. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14.15. Oh what an emancipation hath Chriſt here wrought! That Chriſt hath conquered it, 'tis clear in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.24. That Propheſie is now accompliſht, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 13.14. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.4. And bleſſed are the conſequences of this Victory to us; <hi>John</hi> 6.39, 40. Why ſhould we fear this <hi>King of Terrors,</hi> who gives his ſtroke, but has no ſting? the ſtab is deep, but the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity ſhort? for vve ſhall have our lives again, <hi>which are hid with Chriſt in God till Chriſt appear,</hi> Col. 3.3, 4. And Soul death is eſcaped; for <hi>when we are abſent from the body, we ſhall be preſent with the Lord,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.8. Sin bound us over to eternal death by Law; and here vvas the <hi>strength and ſting of Death:</hi> but this Sentence is reverſed <hi>through the Law of the Spirit of Life,</hi> Rom. 8.1, 4. And Death it ſelf can neither come from, nor end in any want of Love in God to us. And how triumphantly doth the Apoſtle ſpeak when animated with this Meditation? <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.32, 39. What an allay is it amidſt our pangs and fears of death, to think up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thoſe Confidences, Encouragements and Conſolations, before, and in, and after the ſhakes and conflicts, yea, and execution of a dying hour, vvhich God allovvs, intends, and is reſolved to give us then! 'Tis novv conſiſtent vvith the deareſt love to die, and introductive of the beſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights and ſtate; and therefore vve have little cauſe to fear it, ſeeing vve ſhall be gainers by it; 'tis but a Moment's blovv, and that ſhall be healed again, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3.</p>
            <p n="4">4. He that is true to his baptiſmal covenant hath novv the title, and ſhall have the honour and advantages of this victory, if God be ſerved and ſought and loved as our great end and happineſs; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.25.26. if we be freely for Chriſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.37. faithful to him, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.10.3.10. <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9,
<pb n="753" facs="tcp:95740:392"/> and fruitful in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.1.10. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.10. if vve live in the ſpirit and vvalk by it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9.17. and ſovv to it, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.8. and if vve heartily and prevailingly anſvver the claims and ends of the Goſpel of the grace of God, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11 15. What need vve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex our ſelves vvith fears, as if vve ſerved a rigid or unfaithful Maſter? Oh let not our unvoluntary vveakneſs and ſurpriſals diſcourage us, for God is merciful, his goodneſs is exceeding great, and our High prieſt is ſenſible of our vveakneſſes, and true to all our intereſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.25, 9, 24. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. 18, 4.14.16.</p>
            <p>And novv having thus prepared the vvay by theſe preliminary Propoſitions, vvhat novv remains for us to do, but to take theſe follovving Directions, vvhich vvill come ſomething cloſer to the caſe in hand?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 1. See that you lay foundations right and deep. How can it be imagined, much leſs expected that unprepared and eſtranged Souls from God and Chriſt ſhould face the challenges and terrors, or eſcape the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of a dying day? vvhat can ſupport the confidence of that man vvho is diſpirited by the deſerved rebuke &amp; buffettings of an exaſperated, becauſe a guilty, conſcience? for conſcience is the mouth of God, and ſpeaks his mind (and vvhat ſpeaks othervviſe in point of charge or cenſure is rather ignorance than conſcience) and by his order and commiſſion, and in his name and Majeſty vvhips the careleſs ſoul. It is impoſſible to ſtill the cryes of guilt and vvrath. It is far more eaſie for us to charm and ſtupifie the man than truely cure him. He that is negligent of the main affair is like to bear the ſmartings of his ovvn voluntary vvounds; and the more voluntary our negligence appears to be to our awakened conſciences when ſtartled by gripes and fears of death, the leſs cauſe will there be for help and pity. All fears ariſing from an unconverted ſtate, have God to back and ſharpen them, becauſe they are truly grounded on God's profeſſed reſolution and legal comminations, to bring thoſe fears on them by vvhom they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. So that our only vvay to cure and quell theſe fears, is to remove their Cauſe, by giving up our ſelves to God the Father, to knovv him, love him, and live to him, and to delight our ſelves in God's Image, Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and Favour; in his Son Jeſus Chriſt more than in all the treaſures and delights of lovver things; to knovv the Lord that bought us, and to <hi>ſerve him in righteouſneſs, peace and joy in the holy Ghoſt,</hi> vvith confidence to commit our ſelves to his tendred conduct, government and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and entertain him vvith all ſutableneſs of apprehenſion, affection and converſation to all his excellencies, offices and appearances; to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſvver all his kindneſſes, coſt and care with all ſuch faithful, fruitful, chearful converſations as God &amp; Chriſt determined and deſigned in man's Redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. Yea, to be ruled, aſſiſted and refreſhed by vvhat the Spirit of Grace, and Holineſs and Wiſdom hath done for us, and is ſent from the Father and the Son to perfect and compleat in us; to live the Life of Faith and Holineſs, and endeavour to ſpend our daies in the delightful hopes and fore-taſts of, and ripenings for, and haſting to (or <hi>hastning,</hi> as the vvord imports,<note n="*" place="margin">

<pb n="754" facs="tcp:95740:393"/> Joys and Glory; to make the unſeen vvorld the exerciſe, poiſe and ſpring of your moſt vehement deſires, moſt vigorous purſuit, and moſt inviola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſatisfaction: and in a vvord, to vvalk in all due conſcience of your truſt and charge, to God the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, to others and your ſelves; in all things to think, and ſpeak, and do as in the ſight of God, relation to him, and ſpecial intereſt and delight in him, and not through ignorance, enmity and ſloth, to let the Devil, Fleſh or World mortifie your delight in God, your motions tovvards, affections to, and reſolutions for God. And hearken not to thoſe diſcouraging thoughts and jealouſies of God and Chriſt, vvhich your grand enemy the Prince of lies and darkneſs is ready to abuſe you vvith. Where hath God told you that the vvilling, thoughtful, painful Soul, though much diſtemper'd and imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, ſhall be rejected by him? For vvhen the Son proteſts ſo ſolemnly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt rejecting ſuch as come, he ſpeaks his Father's heart, <hi>Jo.</hi> 6.37, 40. And I profeſs, vvhen I moſt ſeriouſly conſider the terms &amp; tenour of the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Grace, I am much confirmed in this, that all grounded jealouſies, ſuſpitions &amp; diſcouragements as to our hopes of everlaſting happineſs, can only fix upon our voluntary rejecting of God and Chriſt, and holineſs and Heaven: And though many things may humble us, and ought to do it, yet nothing can implead our Title to the purchaſed poſſeſſion, nor our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable hopes at death, vvhen once our vvills are ſixt on Chriſt, and vvell reſolved for him, and prevail upon our lives for vvalking vvorthy of our great Vocation. We have no impoſſible conditions impoſed on us; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if vve conſider Goſpel-aſſiſtances, indulgence and encouragements: for vvhen vve knovv our vvay, as God hath ſhevved it us in Chriſt, and have our hearts inclined and fixt for God, vve are but to exert vvhat ſtrength and povver vve have to ſerve and pleaſe our God, and proportio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nably to our abilities and advantages, to vvait upon God for more, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his inſtituted vvays and methods.

And now our terms of Life are not ſo ſtrict as thoſe on vvhich God dealt vvith health<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, ſound and innocent <hi>Adam;</hi> for novv ſincere and prevalent Faith and Love and Holineſs ſhall reach thoſe Conſolations after Death, vvhich once (<hi>viz.</hi> antecedently to Chriſt's undertaking and compleating ſatisfaction)
<pb n="755" facs="tcp:95740:393"/> they could not do: and therefore if your inſincerity and fundamental un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preparedneſs for your change, be that which ſtarts and feeds your fears, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, to be ſincere and faithful in Covenant-making and Covenant-keeping, and you may be ſure of this, that Death will loſe its ſting and victory, and thereupon its fearful looks; when Sin hath loſt its Throne, and when God and Chriſt have got your hearts, and life-to come concernments influence and rule your purpoſes, projects and purſuits. It is with relation to our manifold temptations, wants and weakneſſes, and all deſpondencies and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements conſequent thereupon, that Chriſt hath undertaken to be our great High Prieſt, Phyſitian, Advocate and Saviour. His ſatisfaction related to our forfeiture of all the good we had in promiſe and poſſeſſion; and his Interceſſion is with reſpect to our great diſtance and unworthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. His deep compaſſions ſuppoſe our Miſery, and his aſſiſtance and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies imply our wants and diſadvantages. We are to be taught, becauſe we are ignorant; and healed, becauſe we are ſick; and diſciplin'd, becauſe ſo prone and ſubject to diſorders; and ſuccoured and ſupported, becauſe we are tempted: and when the heart is once reſigned to Chriſt and God by him, Chriſt looks upon himſelf as much concerned to perfect in and for us every thing that can concern us in life and death, and after death.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Direct.</hi> 2. Labour to underſtand your fears diſtinctly, and know their reaſons, ends and meaſures. We are buffetted in the dark, while we are ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of, and ſo miſtake the reaſons of our fears, and know them not in their original and end. The Devil loves and labours to diſturb us by ſuch boiſterous ſtorms and winds as none ſhall know either whence they come or whither they go; he loves to walk and ſpeak and act in the Clouds to our aſtoniſhment and confuſion, that we may be diſturbed, even when he knows we cannot be deſtroyed; becauſe he ſees our hearts are gone for God. 'Tis here as in Polemical Divinity; a Caſe when it is clearly ſtated and diſcovered, is half anſwered by the ſtating of it; for then our Arguments are driven and directed to a point: but when words and things are ambigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly uſed and rendred, there will be great contention, and but little ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction. We are too often frighted with clouds and ſhadows at a diſtance, but when by near approaches and clear inſpection we underſtand the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, our fears become our ſhame; and therefore to come nearer to the Caſe and our own Conſciences, what makes us thus reluctant and afraid to die?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Is it the loſs of what you muſt be divorced from by death? If ſo, then think a little on what you are like to loſe. What is this ſtate which you muſt leave that it hath ſtoln your hearts away? What is the Wiſe man's Motto on it but <hi>vexatious Vanity?</hi> Eccleſ. 1.14. Is it not a ſtate of blindneſs, enmity and active wickedneſs? a ſtate of diſtance and diſtractions? Is it not a ſtate wherein nothing is more ſure and frequent than ſin &amp; ſorrows? The mind and heart of man are ſooner ſtupified and corrupted, than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably exerciſed and ſatisfied. The pleaſures and delights of this diſtracted tranſient ſtate are moſt near of kin unto the ſluggiſh droſſie part of man his Senſes and his Fancy, and when the impetuous cravings of Senſe and Fancy have got their gluts and ſurfets, the Soul, that nobler and more capacious part, is furiouſly invaded, ſadly impoſed on, and prevented and obſtructed
<pb n="756" facs="tcp:95740:394"/> in its ſublimer exerciſes and enjoyments; it is degraded by a baſe captivity, ſtript of its choiceſt Ornaments and Enrichments, and made to ſlight and quit its beſt concernments, that ſo the brutiſh part of man may rule and ruine all. The excellency of all things here lies in their ordinate uſefulneſs and ſubſerviency to better things, from which when you abſtract them, you have no right, propriety nor proportion in them for you; but by your own averſneſs to be gone from them, you ſhew your little or no love to God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Is it your ſtartling apprehenſion of what you muſt encounter and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain in death, that makes you fear to die? It is true, the terrors, jealouſies and pains, that commonly do attend a dying hour, together with that diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution to which our Natures are averſe, make Death appear an Enemy in the way ready to meet us, like <hi>Balaam</hi>'s Angel, with an amazing Sword, and therefore formidable. But yet the ſerious, painful and reſolved Chriſtian hath many things wherewith to ſcatter or correct the evil influences of all diſcouraging apprehenſions of this amazing exerciſe and change. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Thoſe ſins that have truly and regularly loſt their Throne and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in the heart, ſhall never be the ruin of the man; through Chriſt the domineering and damning power of ſin are left together. He that hath ſubjugated and mortified his vile Affections, Intereſts and Corruptions, and hath broken off his ſins by righteouſneſs, and hath changed his Principles, end, and actions, hath that immortal ſeed of life and peace and joy, which will aſſuredly ripen into his everlaſting life, ſecurity and triumphs, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56, 58. Your former provocations loſe their damning ſtrength, when you have deſerted them by penitent converſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. And when he that <hi>hath the Keys of Death and Hell,</hi> hath told you this (as he hath, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.47.) what have you then to exerciſe your jealouſies and ſad ſuſpitions, but ſinful and groundleſs infidelity, which gives the lie to all thoſe teſtimonies and aſſurances of the ability and fidelity of God and Chriſt, who have engaged themſelves by promiſe to ſave you from thoſe dangers which you fear; and of whoſe gracious Nature the Goſpel, and all thoſe wondrous mercies that attend it have informed you?</p>
            <p n="2">2. This being granted, what then hath the Devil to ſhake your confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences with, but lies and falſhood? 'Tis your own fault to credit Satan when he invalidates the truth of God, and would weaken and enervate all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurances which God hath given you of his reſolved deſign to ſave you. If he can prove that ſin may be repented of and yet unpardoned; that ſin may be pardoned, &amp; yet the Soul undone; that God and Chriſt are either forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, impotent or falſe, then be dejected; but 'tis your comfort, that he hath no other Arguments but what are bottomed on theſe great Abſurdities. And</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the Terrors of that hour, vvhich may ariſe from Satans furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous onſets and aſſaults, God will not let you walk alone; he hath his Rod and Staff in readineſs for your aſſiſtance and ſupport. Chriſt, our compaſſionate High Prieſt, knows what it is to die, he knows the ſubtilty and fury of the Tempter by ſmart experience, and his ſympathy hath taught him pity; and our compaſſionate Head will not forget his exerci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Members under their pains, and terrors, and great temptations at that hour. Chriſt is not exalted above the exerciſe of pity, but went to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="757" facs="tcp:95740:394"/> for the reception and poſſeſſion of that capacity, throne and dignity at God's right hand, which he is reſolved to improve for our ſecurity and relief when we are moſt afflicted and in danger. And</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the pains and ſtroke of Death, they are but ſhort and ſudden, and made our neceſſary paſſage to everlaſting Glory. And may not much be born when all ſhall be ſecured? What are the ſtruglings, gaſps and ſtretches of departing Saints, unto thoſe gripes of Conſcience and fears of vengeance, which are the inward, frequent exerciſes of Sinners when they live and when they die too? Nay it is a great allay unto the bitterneſs and fears of Death, that God hath ſuch rich and mighty cordials and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolations proper for that hour. O! what refreſhments do oft times iſſue and ariſe from thoſe diſcoveries of God's image in us preſence with, and favour for us, which are made by us, when we are forced to retire within, when all things round about us fail, and loſe their intereſt in, and favour with us, becauſe our fleſh decays and waſts through pains and rottenneſs, to which the bewitching dotages of time could make their eaſieſt and moſt ſucceſsful applications! And it oft-times happens that our fears exceed our pains, and that the King of Terrors doth not gripe ſo hard, nor ſtab ſo painfully as we are apt to think and look for; but when the ſtroke is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven indeed, and the pains are gone, how eaſily and quickly do the firſt o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penings of our eternal morning even ſwallow up all the remembrances of our dying ſorrows? Oh, when the joys and viſions of our God invade and exerciſe our departed Souls, then comes the great preluſion and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come pledge of our eternal conqueſt of this laſt enemy; and after a ſhort ſleep of Bodies in the duſt (whilſt Souls retire and go to God) the Trump will found, the Lord will come, the World ſhall periſh, or be refined by the flames, and the dead riſe again, and die no more.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Is it becauſe you fear a change of ſtate to your great diſadvantage when you are dead, that you are loath and dread to die? If ſo, then it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe either, 1. You credit not or queſtion the certainty and excellency of the world to come. Or, 2. Becauſe you do not underſtand and value it. Or, 3. You do ſuſpect your intereſt in and fitneſs for it. If it be the firſt, concoct thoſe Arguments and Intimations which God hath given you, by diligent enquiries, ſober pauſes, faithful meditation; reflect upon the firſt and ſecond Propoſitions, and thoſe more cogent uſeful Treatiſes which are written on this Subject, and wherewith the world abounds; and let not the bribes and flatteries of a vain world divert you, nor the malignant influences of a wanton Fancy corrupt and mortifie the Faculties which God hath given you for this end; for here the light is ready for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared eye.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If you do not underſtand its excellence, and ſo have no value for it, compare both ſtates together, that ſo your choice and value may reſult from wiſdom, and be the product of true and ſober judgment. Is it ſo good to dwell, delight and periſh in the flames of ſmart contention betwixt God and you, or to have your breath and ſpirits expended in dreadful groans and ecchoes to the Apoſtle's deep complaints and cries? in <hi>Rom</hi> 7.18, 21, 23, 24. Is there no melody like heart-reproaches for practical de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſing
<pb n="758" facs="tcp:95740:395"/> and diſpleaſing God? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.3, 4. Is there ſuch harmony and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage in the ſluggiſh exerciſes &amp; motions of diſeaſed ſouls? Is there ſuch pleaſure in dark and difficult diſcoveries, which are but one remove from the thick darkneſs of damning Ignorance and Blindneſs, as that your aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation to be ſent away unto that Element of clearer views and viſions in the other world may well be fixed there? Can you delightfully be expoſed to temptations, to injurious and unworthy thoughts of God, and dwell where God is little diſcerned, prized and ſerved? What! is an Hoſpital ſuch a deſirable habitation, that you are loth to quit it? Are the diſtractions, pains and vanities of a forſaken world ſuch Charms and Loadſtones to your hearts, as to ſet you on building Tabernacles and fixing there? Who ever loved to be expoſed to miſeries, or to build his Palace on the ſands or haſty Streams? and what is this ſtate of Life but the true Theatre and Center of all theſe woes and miſeries?<note place="margin">But of this, ſee more in <hi>Prop.</hi> 2.</note> But if you look above, and pierce the Heavens, there you will meet with clear diſcoveries and vehement flames of Love, and all deſirable, unconceivable vigour, liberty and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in an immortal ſtate.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Is it becauſe you do ſuſpect your intereſt in, and fitneſs for the life to come? If ſo, then know the terms of Life, and try your ſtate thereby. Do you not know what God is, believe what he ſaith, accept what he tenders, and do what he commands? Know you not who Chriſt is, what he hath done, what he expects, what he promiſes, and will do? Are you an enemy to the Graces, Truths and motions of the Spirit, and to his directing, quickning and comforting influences? Are ye not dead to ſin, &amp; alive to God through Chriſt? Is not another Life the exerciſe and object of your chief deſire, purſuit and ſatisfaction? have you no prevalent inclinations, affections and reſolutions to renounce the World, Fleſh, Devil, and to diſcharge all your Duties to God, yourſelves and others, with wiſdom, holineſs, activity and courage? And to do all this as in the ſight of God, and with delight, as in the hopes and proſpect of a better world; and to expect what God hath promiſed, in the ways which he commands. If theſe things be in you, and abound, your hearts are right, condition ſafe, and title good. If you be wanting here, this is your way of reparation and ſecurity: Do theſe things, and Death is yours; and when theſe things are done, all your diſcouraging doubts &amp; fears are anſwered and diſpelled, by being clearly underſtood. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is one thing to be fit to die, and another thing to know it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is one thing to have your Title good, another thing to be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, and ſo fully ripe for Heaven immediately.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is one thing to have a ſerious, fixed heart and will for God, and another thing to have paſſionate affections, which depend more upon the temper of the Body, than the power and ripeneſs of the Grace of God upon the heart.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It is one thing what we cannot be, though we would be with ſtrength and readineſs of will, &amp; another thing what we have little or no will to be.</p>
            <p n="5">5. It is one thing to love and hate proportionably to what God and ſin are and deſerve; and 'tis another thing to love and hate as God requires in proportion to our ſtrength, and with reference to our Work and Joy, And,</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="759" facs="tcp:95740:395"/>6. It is one thing to have Corruption dwell in us, and another thing to have it rule.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It is one thing to be tempted of the Devil, and another thing to yield thereto. And,</p>
            <p n="8">8. It is one thing to have ground of Hope and Joy, and another, to have the ſenſe thereof.</p>
            <p n="9">9. Joy is alſo conſiderable, as our Duty, and God's Gift.</p>
            <p>And theſe 9 Diſtinctions well obſerved, rightly applied, and carefully improved, will go exceeding far towards anſwering all thoſe Doubts which animate unwarrantable Fears of Death in thoſe whoſe hearts are right; whilſt their hopes are low, their jealouſies great, their Spirits faint, and ſo their Lives uncomfortable, through their own ignorant and ſad Miſtakes.</p>
            <p>Infer. 1. <hi>Chriſtian Religion at the worſt, is better than a courſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs at the best.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 2. <hi>Mens carriages will be anſwerable to the truth and power of their Faith and Hope, in reference to the comforts of the unſeen world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 3. <hi>All the dejectedneſs of thorow-Gracious Christians ariſes from their inconſiderateneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 4. <hi>To underſtand the regular meaſures of Fear and Love, is of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable concernment in our Chriſtian Courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 5. <hi>To look and act for joys to come, and to make them quickning arguments to our obedience and preparations, is an eſſential part of our Religion,</hi> 2 John 8.</p>
            <p>Inf. 6. <hi>Immoderate love of Life and fear of Death is ſinful and of dangerous conſequence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 7. <hi>It is of great uſe to underſtand the truth and worth of the Comforts of a well-finiſhed Courſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 8. <hi>Infidelity in whole or in part, as far as it reaches, cannot but morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie thoſe noble diſpoſitions and neceſſary preparations which Chriſtianity calls us to; for it is impoſſible to be religious any further than God's exiſtence and rewarding excellencies and reſolutions are credited,</hi> Heb. 1-1.6.</p>
            <p>Inf. 9. <hi>The want or diſtance of pertinent and ſmart temptations is the only reaſon of perſeverance in the formality of Godlineſs amongſt Profeſſors whoſe hearts and aims are not upon, and for the joys of Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 10. <hi>To have our Faith and Hope well fixt and exerciſed, is the beſt Method and Expedient for Chearfulneſs, Conſtancy and Courage in the whole frame of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian ſufferings and duty. This makes exalted active Souls in Godlineſs, and for it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 11. <hi>Then what conſiderable friends are God and Chriſt to Chriſtianity and ſerious Chriſtians, who have furniſhed us with hopes and arguments drawn from the certainty and tranſcendent excellence of joys to come.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Inf. 12. <hi>No man hath cauſe to quarrel with what he is called to do and ſuffer for the Chriſtian Cauſe, nor reaſon to decline Religion becauſe of difficulties in the way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Inferences ſhould and might be enlarged upon, but that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined Bounds of a ſingle Sermon muſt not be exceeded.

            <p>WE have two large and weighty diſcourſes of Jeſus Chriſt to his Diſciples newly before his Death;<note place="margin">Joh. 14, 15, 16.</note> the one to comfort them againſt his departure out of the world, the other to prep re both them and us againſt his return to judge the World; of which the preſent Chapter treateth, and part of the precedent.</p>
            <p>In the former Chapter we have Chriſt's Exhortation unto watchfulneſs againſt his ſecond coming;<note place="margin">Chap. 24.42.</note> urged from the uncertainty of the time of his return: And this Exhortation is continued in this 25th Chapter, in which there are theſe three parts. The firſt is contained in the Parable of the <hi>Ten Virgins,</hi> from the firſt to the fourteenth Verſe. The ſecond, in that of the <hi>ſeveral Talents</hi> given by the <hi>Maſter</hi> to his <hi>Servants,</hi> to be employed and improved by them againſt his return, from the fourteenth to the thirty firſt Verſe. The third containeth the Deſcription of the <hi>Coming of Chriſt to judge the world;</hi> from Verſe 31, to the end of the Chapter.</p>
            <p>My Text lieth in the firſt Parable. <hi>viz.</hi> That of the <hi>Ten Virgins;</hi> of which, <hi>five were wiſe, and five were fooliſh.</hi> And whereas Chriſt very of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>opened his mouth in Parables,</hi> none of them comes cloſer to the Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of men than this, as I may have occaſion to ſhew hereafter.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not inſiſt in opening the whole Parable; ſeeing the following Diſcourſe will take in moſt thereof: I will haſten therefore to that part thereof which I have now read unto you.</p>
            <p>Now as for theſe <hi>Ten Virgins,</hi> they profeſſed alike; and who were the <hi>wiſe,</hi> and who the <hi>fooliſh,</hi> lay undiſcovered till the Midnight-cry was heard; <hi>Behold, the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him; behold, he cometh
<pb n="761" facs="tcp:95740:396"/> with Clouds, he cometh to judge the Earth; he ſhall judge the world in righteouſneſs, and his People with equity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This was an awaking Cry to ſlumbring Virgins in the midſt of the dark and black night, who little dream'd that Chriſt was ſo near at hand; but wiſe and fooliſh are ſtartled and raiſed with it, &amp; all of them betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves forthwith to the trimming of their Lamps; when the fooliſh find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theirs extinguiſhed, deſire the wiſe to communicate of their Oil unto them; they ſpeak like perſons not well awaked: For though there is a Communion of Saints in the exerciſe of their Graces mutually among themſelves, yet there is no communication of perſonal Graces to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and moreover, <hi>the juſt ſhall live by his own,</hi> and not by <hi>another's Faith.</hi> What therefore ſay the <hi>Wiſe?</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Nequaquam; By no means,</hi> ſay they, <hi>leſt there be not enough for us and you;</hi> we have no Oil to ſpare; <hi>but go ye ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to them that ſell, and buy for your ſelves. Salſa deriſio, non cohortatio,</hi> ſaith <hi>Beza.</hi> The <hi>Wiſe</hi> anſwer the <hi>Fooliſh wiſely;</hi> yea, wittily upbraid them for their Folly; for was this a time to get Grace, when the Bridegroom was come, and time was ſlipt? Is that a time to have Oil to buy, when we ſhould have Oil to burn? Or is this Oil to be bought with money and price, which is moſt freely given in the day of Grace and Mercy? What therefore do the <hi>fooliſh</hi> do? As if they fooliſhly underſtood an <hi>Exprobration</hi> for an <hi>Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> they are thinking now of buying; <hi>but while they went to buy, the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom came, and they that were ready, went in with him, and the Door was ſhut.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words you have, 1. The going of the <hi>Fooliſh</hi> to buy. 2. The coming of the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> to the <hi>Marriage.</hi> 3. The preparedneſs of the <hi>Wiſe</hi> to enter with him. 4. The <hi>ſhutting of the Door</hi> after them.</p>
            <p>But not to inſiſt upon theſe things diſtinctly, let me gather up the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ſcope of our Saviour in the words; which is to ſhew us,</p>
            <p>Obſ. <hi>That very miſerable is the condition of ſuch, eſpecially Profeſſors of the Goſpel, who have Grace to ſeek and get at the coming of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Obſerv.</note> 
               <hi>and as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py is the ſtate of ſuch who are ready to enter with him into the Bride-Chamber of eternal Reſt and Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the Point that I ſhall inſiſt upon; which, in the Application, will lead me to the Queſtion that is to be ſpoken to.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I ſay, <hi>Very miſerable is the condition of ſuch, i. e.</hi> of ſuch in general, and not only of ſuch as profeſs to Chriſt, but of others alſo that profeſs not to him at all, as to any ſhew of Godlineſs in their lives, ſuch as are the far greateſt part of men; yea, and commonly too, where the Goſpel is preached, who are (ſure enough) to ſeek not only of the Oil of Grace in their Veſſels, but of Light alſo in their Lamps.</p>
            <p n="2">2. But more miſerable is the ſtate of ſuch who are Profeſſors of the Goſpell, and yet have Grace to ſeek and get at ſuch an hour; yet ſo will it be, as you ſee in my Text; for ſuch are theſe <hi>fooliſh Virgins,</hi> who go to purchaſe Grace when the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> cometh.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Very miſerable is their caſe, becauſe the <hi>Door</hi> of the <hi>Bride-Chamber</hi> is ſhut againſt them. They profeſs to the <hi>Bridegroom</hi> in common with the <hi>VViſe;</hi> and now the <hi>VViſe</hi> are admitted, and the <hi>Fooliſh</hi> excluded: For the <hi>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting Doors of Glory</hi> ſtand open unto <hi>ſaving,</hi> but never unto <hi>common</hi> Grace.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="762" facs="tcp:95740:397"/>4. It muſt needs be then, that the ſtate of the <hi>VViſe</hi> is very bleſſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are prepared, and their Lights are burning, and their loins girded, and their Oil of Grace in exerciſe when Chriſt is coming to them, and therefore they are brought to the <hi>King in rayment of Needle work;</hi> yea, with gladneſs and rejoycing they are brought, and <hi>enter into the King's Palace,</hi> where <hi>the wiſe ſhall ſhine as the brightneſs of the firmament, and even as the Sun in the Kingdom of their Father.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall not ſtand upon this ſecond part of the Doctrine, to ſhew the happineſs of the <hi>Wiſe prepared Virgins;</hi> the Time, and Queſtion to be handled, will not permit it; only ſomething I ſhall ſpeak to it in the cloſe of this Exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Therefore, in opening of the other part, <hi>viz.</hi> The miſery of ſuch as profeſs to Jeſus Chriſt, who have Grace to get and ſeek at the coming of the Bridegroom; let me ſhew you that there are ſuch as profeſs at an high rate, and yet are no better than <hi>fooliſh Virgins;</hi> for ſuch are theſe here in my Text, who riſe very high in their Profeſſions, as excelling the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary rank of Pretenders unto Chriſt. How ſo?</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are Virgins; and what is that? 1. They have renounced Antichriſtian Idolatry, and all the falſe worſhips of the <hi>Mother of Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots,</hi> and they will in no wiſe conform to the Inventions of men, as it is ſaid of the <hi>hundred forty four thouſand which ſtand with the Lamb on Mount Sion; theſe are they that have not defiled themſelves with women; for they are Virgins:</hi> Rev. 14.14. <hi>i.e.</hi> They have abandoned the ſpiritual Fornicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the <hi>great Whore,</hi> and <hi>kept their garments undefiled</hi> in that reſpect.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have alſo renounced the pollutions of the world <hi>through the knowledg of the Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 2 Pet 2.20. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Puddles or Sloughs wherein the Swine of the world do wallow; they flee from theſe as the word doth ſignifie: yea, they are not only <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, but alſo <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, not only ſuch as flee from theſe Puddles, but ſuch as (at leaſt ſeemingly) abhor them. For theſe Virgins are too neat to defile them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the world's mire and dirt; they ariſe (you ſee) and trim their Lamps; they are therefore trim Virgins, who have not viſibly defiled themſelves.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And more eſpecially, they are Virgins, in profeſſing Eſpouſals to Chriſt the Bridegroom, who, as it was prefigured under the Law, <hi>marrieth a wife in her Virginity,</hi> Lev, 21.13. Theſe Virgins therefore are viſibly eſpou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto Chriſt, and joyned in the ſame Communion with the wiſe; for here is a fellowſhip between the Ten; they ſtand at ſo great a diſtance from the world's defilements, that they profeſs Communion viſibly with the choi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſt Saints. And indeed, the Saints in Goſpel Fellowſhip are Virgins, and every Church of Chriſt is a Virgin: Hence, ſaith the Apoſtle to the Church at <hi>Corinth,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one Husband, that I may preſent you a chaſte Virgin unto Chriſt.</hi> And therefore the Members of the Churches are to be reputed ſuch,<note place="margin">Eadem eſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio partis &amp; totius.</note> ſeeing they are parts of the ſame homogeneal Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. And thus you ſee how theſe Profeſſors are Virgins.</p>
            <p n="2">2. They have their Lamps as well as the <hi>Wiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. In that they are perſons of light and underſtanding, guides to the
<pb n="763" facs="tcp:95740:397"/> blind, and lights to them that are in darkneſs, inſtructers of the fooliſh, and yet themſelves but fools.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Word</hi> is alſo a <hi>Lamp to their feet, and a Light unto their paths,</hi> ſo far, that they will conform their Actions to the Rule; for <hi>the Commandment is a Lamp, and the Law is a Light,</hi> Prov. 6.23. And in theſe two reſpects <hi>(their knowledge and external conformity)</hi> their Lamps ſhine as brightly as the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> do.</p>
            <p n="3">3. They profeſs not only their expectation of Chriſt's coming, but make alſo preparation for it, in that they go forth together <hi>with the wiſe to meet the Bridegroom.</hi> And though at laſt they are found unready, yet they prepare ſo far that they <hi>go forth to meet</hi> him, as hoping to partake in the bleſſing and comfort of the Nuptial day; whereby it appeareth that <hi>they had taſted of the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come.</hi> And though they fell into their midnights-ſleep, ſo did the <hi>wiſe Virgins</hi> alſo. For it will indeed be ſuch a drowſie time immediately before the coming of Chriſt, that not one of ten that profeſs unto him, will be awaked; no, nor one in five of ſuch as do truly love him. And at the firſt too, they only ſlumbered, and neither ſlept nor waked; but by degrees they fall faſt aſleep; for Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath its gradual progreſſions before it be midnight with the Soul. But this was not proper to theſe <hi>five,</hi> but common to all the <hi>Ten.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. They are no leſs awaked than the <hi>Wiſe</hi> with the Midnight-cry of <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him;</hi> for ſaith the text, <hi>Then all thoſe Virgins aroſe;</hi> ſo that they take the Alarm equally with the reſt. Thus one may be awaked with the Cry of the word of God, and yet be void of Grace in his heart.</p>
            <p n="5">5. They likewiſe fall to trimming of their Lamps no leſs than the <hi>Wiſe Virgins</hi> do; <hi>i.e.</hi> They fall to furbiſhing of that Profeſſion which had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted Scurf and foulneſs in the time of their midnight-ſecurity. For now they looked upon themſelves as eſpouſed unto Jeſus Chriſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to deck and trim themſelves with Ornaments againſt the Nuptials, as conſcious that preparation is moſt neceſſary for thoſe who deſire to be found of Chriſt in peace at his appearance; for there is no meeting him with Lamps untrimmed, and Lives unguided by the Word.</p>
            <p n="6">6. They perſevere unto the Bridegroom's coming; they were guilty of ſecurity indeed, and ſo were the <hi>Wiſe</hi> alſo; but here is neither Apoſtaſie, nor diſcovered Hypocriſie thus far; <hi>viz.</hi> until the <hi>Midnight-cry.</hi> They held out to the laſt, and dye at Heaven's door; and, like the <hi>Levite</hi>'s Concubine, <hi>with their hands upon the Threſhold,</hi> Jud. 19.27. Thus they profeſſed far; for ſuch a ſort (I ſay) there is, that riſe thus high, and yet are <hi>fooliſh Virgins.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. In the next place let us conſider where the defect is, and wherein the folly of theſe Virgins lieth. For you have heard of their Virginity in their ſeparation from and profeſſion againſt Antichriſtian Idolatry and mens Inventions, and alſo in their eſcaping the world's pollutions; and you have ſeen their Virginity in their Eſpouſals unto Chriſt, and viſible Communion with the <hi>Wiſe</hi> in the enjoyment of Goſpel-Ordinances; you have heard alſo of their Light, their Hopes, their Awaking, their Trimming their Lamps, and how near they came to Heaven. But here
<pb n="764" facs="tcp:95740:398"/> now was the <hi>one thing lacking,</hi> that all this was the effect only of an exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and ineffectual work, wherein, though there was ſomething internal, it was but light and tranſient, which never wrought a thorow and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful change of the heart; whereas the <hi>Wiſe</hi> had an inward and power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Call to Chriſt, inſomuch that the Goſpel <hi>came to them not in word on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but alſo in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> whereby they were made to <hi>know wiſdom in the hidden part,</hi> and became Virgins in affection and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, as well as in profeſſion and action. Mean while the operations of the Spirit are languid, weak and tranſient upon the hearts of fooliſh ones, as we ſee in the ſtony ground, in which there is no thorow, pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful and abiding change. And hence it is ſaid, <hi>The fooliſh took their Lamps, but took no Oyl with them;</hi> they wanted the Oyl of the Spirit of God, and his ſaving gifts in the Veſſels of their hearts. Briefly, the wiſe Virgins were ſincere profeſſors and followers of Chriſt; the other, meer Hypocrites and fooliſh Builders, who laid their foundation on the Sand. And yet I do not ſay, That fooliſh Virgins have always ſaving Grace to ſeek at the coming of Chriſt; becauſe there is Repentance and Pardon to be had in time for Hypocrites. A fooliſh Profeſſor may go forth to meet the Bridegroom, with his Lamp only in his hand, and no Oyl at all in his heart, and yet he may meet with timely awakings by the way, and Chriſt may infuſe the Oil of ſaving Grace into his heart before the Midnight-cry, whereby he becometh wiſe in the latter end, who was a fool in the beginning; for Chriſt calls upon Hypocrites as well as others to repent.<note place="margin">Mat. 23.26. Jam. 4.8.</note> Hypocritical <hi>Sardis</hi> is called hereunto as well as the other Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin-Churches of <hi>Aſia:</hi> And many unſound Profeſſors have been effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally converted, when many others have lived and died in their hypocriſie; and perſeverance in profeſſion unto Chriſt is no Argument of a good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate to a dying Virgin, except ſhe be <hi>found in the way of wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. There remaineth one thing more to be ſpoken to for the clearing of the Point; and that is, That very miſerable is the ſtate of ſuch as theſe who have Grace to get when Chriſt cometh. <hi>For the Door is ſhut upon them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In which words is declared their puniſhment of loſs; which ſome have thought to be greater than that of Senſe; which I ſhall not diſpute, but briefly diſcourſe of that of loſs, as mentioned only in the Text; which is inevitably followed by that of Senſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. All the profeſſion of theſe Virgins is loſt, their prayers, praiſes, humblings, external reformations, communications both of their world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubſtance, and likewiſe of their Parts and Gifts; and ſo are their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and their witneſs-bearing to the Truth, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> All theſe are excluded from God's acceptance of them, through want of an intereſt in the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom; for none of theſe were offered up in Chriſt, and the greateſt and moſt glorious ſervices, without unfeigned Faith and Love, are nothing, <hi>Lev.</hi> 17.5, 6. <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.15. <hi>Col.</hi> 3.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1, 2, 3.</p>
            <p n="2">2. All opportunities and means of Grace are now loſt, never to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed more; the door of opportunity (as the Apoſtle calleth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.12. &amp; 16.9.) is for ever ſhut againſt them; they have ſurvived all their ſeaſons, which now give place unto Eternity. For the Bridegroom
<pb n="765" facs="tcp:95740:398"/> cometh firſt by Death; and <hi>it is appointed unto men once to dye, and after this the Judgment;</hi> not, <hi>after this, and further means of Grace;</hi> not, <hi>after this a Sabbath, or a Sermon, or a time to pray and repent;</hi> but, <hi>after this the Judgment:</hi> And what then ſucceeds the Judgment? the perpetual execution of it: in which reſpect it is called <hi>the eternal Judgment, Heb.</hi> 6.2. So that the door of opportunity is now for ever ſhut.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There is a door of Hope, and that alſo is ſhut againſt them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. Theſe Virgins had hopeful expectations of entrance with the Bridegroom; for that was it they waited for; whereas now their hope is periſhed and hath given up the Ghoſt, for at beſt, it was but a fine-ſpun <hi>Spider's web,</hi> Job 8.14. but never a true lively hope.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It followeth upon this, that the door of Grace is ſhut, never to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened more. Chriſt ſtretched forth <hi>his hands to them all the day long, but now the accepted time and day of ſalvation is ended,</hi> and there is no further place for Grace and Mercy, nor hopes of <hi>ſeeing the King in his Beauty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. They have now loſt their Communion with the wiſe Virgins, who are ſafe within the door; that whereas they ſeparated from the world, to joyn in fellowſhip with Saints, they are now for ever ſeparated from the Saints to take <hi>their portion with the world,</hi> Mat. 7.23. Time was, when the Door of Chriſt's houſe upon earth (which is the Church of God) ſtood open to them as well as unto the wiſe, and the Key of the Kingdom of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven gave them admiſſion into this lower houſe, upon their viſible ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to his Rule and Government, and they had entrance equally with the wiſe to partake of all the priviledges thereof; and now when they think to enter into the Upper Houſe of Eternal Glory, the key is turned againſt them.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Theſe Virgins now have loſt their Vails, and are diſcovered to the wiſe, who ſee not the Virgins their Companions brought to the King in fellowſhip with themſelves in Glory; and now they are diſcovered al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo to themſelves and to all the world, and known to be what they are; ſo that they have nothing henceforth to cover them but everlaſting ſhame and contempt. Time was, that they were taken together in the ſame net with them who are within the door; but the <hi>Angels have gathered the good fiſh into their Veſſels, and caſt away the bad.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Mat. 18.47, 48, 49.</note> That therefore now is <hi>taken from them which they ſeemed to have,</hi> even the ſhews and ſhadows of that Grace they never had, by him that <hi>brings to light the hidden things of darkneſs, and maketh manifeſt the counſels of the heart.</hi> Their Lamps were going out when they awaked at the <hi>Midnight-cry,</hi> v.8. and now they are quite extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, never to ſhine more; the Word ſhall ſhine no longer to them, nor their Knowledge and other Gifts to any.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It now remains, that they who ere while were in their midnights-ſleep, are now in their midnights darkneſs; even there <hi>where the light of a candle ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſhined, nor the voice of the Bridegroom and the Bride was ever heard:</hi> For they are driven out of light into darkneſs; and an eternal night of grief and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate ſorow, to <hi>have their portion with Hypocrites,</hi> their Lamps to be put out in obſcure darkneſs. This door of ſeparation (like to the pillar of the cloud between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and <hi>Egyptians</hi>) yields light to the wiſe within, and darkneſs to the fools without.</p>
            <pb n="766" facs="tcp:95740:399"/>
            <p>Theſe things (which are moſtly Textu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>l) are enough to demonſtrate the miſery of theſe Virgins; I need not ſpend further time to dilate upon the pain of loſs, nor at all upon the pain of Senſe, which followeth inevitably upon what you have already heard. Let me therefore apply the Truth thus opened, and haſten to the <hi>Queſtion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe.</hi> Are theſe things ſo? What then ſhall we think of ſuch, who fall as ſhort of the fooliſh Virgins, as the fooliſh do of the wiſe? And where ſhall the prophane and ignorant Sinner appear? O how many are there in a La<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d of Light, who are far from this Virginity fore mentioned, as being defiled with Antichriſt's and the world's pollutions? How many, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver engaged in the Saints Communion, and who never pretended to the Bridegroom, never waited for his Coming, never went ſorth to meet him, never regarded a Lamp of Light without them in the Word, nor of the knowledge of Chriſt within them, and who are ſo faſt aſleep in ſin, that no midnight-cry can awake them? Surely the door of Grace will be ſhut a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt theſe when they dye, who never cared to come near it whil'ſt they lived. And if fooliſh Virgins per ſh with their hands upon the gates of Glory, what will become of them who live &amp; dye at ſo vaſt a diſtance from them? And if five of ten that go ſorth to meet and marry the Bridegroom, are yet ſhut out of doors, what can they expect who go out to meet him in an hoſtile manner and profeſſed oppoſition to him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Point admoniſheth all that profeſs unto the Bridegroom, to take heed of reſting in ought that is common to them, with the fooliſh Virgins. For <hi>except your righteouſneſs exceed theirs, you ſhall in no wiſe enter into the Kingdom of heaven,</hi> Mat. 5.20. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; there are two Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in the Original Text; as much as to ſay, <hi>you ſhall not, you ſhall not enter.</hi> The Door is double lock'd againſt them. Now you have heard of their attainments, their Virginity, <hi>i.e.</hi> their proteſting againſt Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Superſtition, and alſo the world's pollutions; yea, their joyning in Communion with ſincere Believers, their light, their fellowſhip in all the Ordinances, their expectations of the Bride-grooms coming and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it, their awaking and taking the Alarm of his Approach, the trimming of their Lamps, and perſeverance in theſe attainments to the end. Verily theſe are great things, and more than we can find in many that profeſs to Chriſt this day: Surely our Lord Jeſus did fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee the ſlumbring frame of all the Virgins both wiſe and fooliſh from age to age, eſpecially againſt his coming, that he hath left behind him ſuch a Parable as this to awaken them, which is ſufficient to make one ſtart in his midnight-ſleep, and ariſe and cloath himſelf with tremblings. You read, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, with 9. of <hi>enlightnings and taſting of the heavenly gift, partaking of the Holy Ghoſt, taſting alſo of the good Word of God, and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the world to come,</hi> and yet theſe things do not infalliby <hi>attend Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> but may at laſt determine in Apoſtaſie. Here are three things; <hi>Illuminations, Common Gifts and Operations,</hi> and <hi>Taſtings,</hi> 1. Of the <hi>Heavenly Gift,</hi> which is Chriſt. 2. <hi>Of the Promiſe.</hi> 3. <hi>Of the Joyes of Heaven.</hi> But (I ſay) theſe things do not infallibly conclude <hi>Salvation,</hi> except effectual ſaving Grace be joyned with them; for they may be
<pb n="767" facs="tcp:95740:399"/> where there is no ſaving Grace, and they may be where there is, or they may precede a ſaving work; but bare illuminations, as to the Doctrine of Chriſt, and attaining the Literal knowledge of the Goſpel, is no ſaving work. The like may be ſaid of <hi>common Gifts</hi> and <hi>Operations</hi> of the Holy Ghoſt, as, a Gift of Prayer, of Preaching, of Utterance, of Tongues, and of working Miracles, as in the primitive times: So for the <hi>Taſts</hi> either of the heavenly Gift, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and the glorious divine things of the Goſpel, or of the <hi>good word of God</hi> in the Promiſes, or of the <hi>joys of the world to come;</hi> all theſe things may be found <hi>in temporaries,</hi> Mat. 7.22, 23. Supernatural gifts are given ſometimes to meer Natural men. <hi>John Baptiſt's</hi> Hearers <hi>rejoyced in his light for a ſeaſon;</hi> the ſtony ground <hi>received the word with Joy;</hi> and even <hi>Balaam</hi> had a taſte for the time, of the <hi>world to come,</hi> when he deſired to dye the death of the <hi>righteous;</hi> and theſe <hi>fooliſh Virgins</hi> lived to the laſt in hopes of entring into Glory. But the immortal Soul cannot live upon light, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perficial Taſts, which yield only a tranſient reliſh; there muſt be a feeding on, as well as a taſting of <hi>the heavenly gift, the good word of promiſe, and the Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of an higher world.</hi> Taſting is a thing diſtinct from feeding; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when the Apoſtle uſeth a ſimilitude to illuſtrate what he had ſaid of this kind of taſting, in diſtinction from eating and drinking, digeſting and living upon the things thus taſted, ſaith he, <hi>The Earth that drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is dreſſed, receiveth a bleſſing from God; but that which beareth thorns and briars, is rejected, and near to curſing, and their end is to be burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> In which compariſon he intimateth, that as it is not enough that the rain doth fall upon the earth, except the earth doth drink it in, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which it will not be fruitful nor receive a bleſſing; even ſo it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficeth not that theſe heavenly things do fall more lightly upon the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual palat, except the Soul ſo drinketh them in, as that it liveth upon them; for then (and then alone) it receiveth a bleſſing from the Lord; whereas otherwiſe ſuch perſons are rejected and nigh to curſing, and their end is to be burned.</p>
            <p>Brethren! The Parable now in hand, and that Text to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> are of an awaking nature; for God knoweth our ſlumbring diſpoſitions. You have heard then of the Attainments of theſe Virgins, and of thoſe Profeſſors mentioned by the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Heb. 6.9, to the end. And they are indeed good things; but, ſaith he, <hi>there are better, and ſuch as do accompany ſalvation:</hi> For in the ſecond part of that Chapter, he ſpeaketh of <hi>the work of Faith, the labour of love, and the patience of hope in the ſight of God and the Father,</hi> 1 Theſſ. 1.5. <hi>i.e.</hi> Such as are not ſpurious and adulterine, but germane and genuine, and will endure the Teſt as to their ſincerity, in the preſence of an heart-ſearching God. And by theſe infalible Notes we muſt take our meaſures. <hi>Illuminations, common gifts and operations,</hi> and light tranſient <hi>tasts</hi> and reliſhes are no evidences; we muſt have theſe <hi>better things</hi> to bear up our hearts againſt the coming of the Bridegroom. It ſufficeth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ot to be enrolled among Profeſſors, and to enjoy the charitable thoughts and approbations of the wiſeſt Virgins under Heaven. It is ſingular mercy to be rightly guided in
<pb n="768" facs="tcp:95740:400"/> ſelf-eſteem and valuation; for they that meaſure themſelves by themſelves, or compare themſelves among themſelves, are not wiſe The Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. would not have us to take up with the poſitive degree of <hi>good things;</hi> but to take our aims by the comparative of <hi>better.</hi> Theſe <hi>good things</hi> are more light, ineffectual and ſuperficial, and too often like the Seal that is impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon bare Paper; whereas theſe <hi>better things</hi> are like the Seal's impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on the Wax.</p>
            <p>Yet let no trembling Soul or broken reed be affrighted at the end of theſe fooliſh Virgins, to ſee the Door thus ſhut againſt them; the tender heart of Jeſus Chriſt aimeth not at our conſternation, but awaking, and to prepare and haſten us unto Glory before the Key be turned. Nor doth his Apoſtle, in the foreſaid place, <hi>deſpiſe the day of ſmall things,</hi> but his real ſcope and purpoſe is, to excite Profeſſors to look carefully to their foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, and then to go on unto perfection, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.1. And bleſſed for ever be the Lord for the ſecond part of that ſixth Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> in the cloſe whereof we may ſee the afflicted heart toſſed with tempeſts, and not comforted, yet hoping in Mercy, and fleeing to Jeſus as his Refuge, and caſting the Anchor of his floating Soul <hi>within the Vail, whither the Fore-runner is entred for us,</hi> who himſelf was once toſſed in the Ship of the Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Church, <hi>albeit without ſin;</hi> but is now gone aſhore to heaven as our fore-runner, both to look to our Anchor, which is faſtned there, and to hold all faſt, and to draw our toſſed Ship to ſhore, and to ſee all ſafe; that where our fore-runner is, there may we be alſo. And thus the ſweet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that Chapter doth fully recompence the ſeverity of its begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. <hi>Let us comfort our ſelves and one another with theſe things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You have heard the miſerable condition of ſuch (eſpecially Profeſſors of the Goſpel and Pretenders to Chriſt) who have Grace to ſeek at his coming. As for the hapy ſtate of ſuch as are ready to enter in with him into the Bride-chamber of eternal peace and joy, I ſhall ſpeak a little in the Cloſe.</p>
            <p>Now therefore in the remainder of this Exerciſe, it will be expected, as ſeaſonable, that it be conſidered, <hi>What gifts of Grace are chiefly to be in exerciſe in order to an actual Preparation for the coming of Chriſt by Death and Judgment?</hi> For his coming is firſt by Death, and then by Judgment. And I ſay, an <hi>actual Preparation,</hi> becauſe there is always a general and habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual preparedneſs to meet Chriſt Jeſus in hearts that are truly godly, but not always a particular actual fitneſs: And this we ſee here in the five wiſe Virgins, who are found in their midnight-ſleep, with Lamps that have need of trimming at the coming of Chriſt. Thus <hi>Hezekiah</hi> was fit to dye, as to a general and habitual fitneſs, in that he could aſſert his ſincerity before God, when the meſſage of death was brought him; but he was to ſeek of a particular actual fitneſs, in that he begs for longer life with prayers and plenty of tears. The Meſſage of Death awaked him, and the holy man is ſtartled, and hath his Lamp to trim; for the tidings of his death at hand, was as much in effect, as if it had been ſaid unto him by the Prophet, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go forth</hi> Hezekiah <hi>to meet him.</hi> The nature of his diſtemper, which ſome by the remedy (a lump of Figs appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="769" facs="tcp:95740:400"/> to the Bile) conceive to have been the <hi>Peſtilence;</hi> and this, conſidered with the ſhortneſs and ſharpneſs of the Meſſage, and the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s quick &amp; abrupt departure from him, &amp; that the King had then no Heir to ſucceed him in the Throne, and alſo that he was now at the full ſtrength of Nature, being but nine and thirty years of age; and his fear alſo what might become of his Kingdom, and of his former Reformation after the grand Apoſtaſie of his Father <hi>Ahaz,</hi> I ſay, theſe conſiderations made him to apprehend that there was a rebuke of God in this preſent Diſpenſation, and therefore he is loth to dye under a temporal frown; albeit his a vow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed integrity would (at the worſt) have ſeen him ſafe at heaven. For though a Child of God cannot dye in his debt, yet he is unwilling to depart under the ſenſe of his temporal diſpleaſure, ſo as the good Prophet did, whom the Lion ſlew at his return from <hi>Bethel</hi> to <hi>Judah,</hi> 2 Kings 13.24. When <hi>David</hi> therefore was under God's rebukes for ſin, and even almoſt conſumed with the blow of his hand, he betakes himſelf (as <hi>Hezekiah</hi> did) to prayers and tears; ſaith he, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.10, 11. to the end, <hi>Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear to my Cry, hold not thy peace at my tears; for I am a ſtranger with thee, and a Sojourner as all my Fathers were; O ſpare me, that I may recover ſtrength before I go hence and be no more.</hi> Thus you ſee that the dear Children of God, who have a general and habitual fitneſs to meet Jeſus Chriſt when he is coming to them by Death and Judgment, may yet be to ſeek of a particular actual preparation.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Before I come to the anſwer of the Queſtion, let me premiſe this alſo; That though a ſtate of Grace is here ſuppoſed, ſeeing Grace can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be exerciſed where it is not; yet there may be need to have it clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inaſmuch as the want thereof is a great hinderance in the way of this Duty. You know that one that feareth God, and <hi>obeyeth the voice of his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, may yet <hi>walk in darkneſs and ſee no light,</hi> Iſa. 50.10. and he may ſay with <hi>Jonah,</hi> he is <hi>caſt out of God's ſight, and his ſoul is filled with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles when his life draweth nigh unto the Grave;</hi> wherefore let your eye be not only on your Lamp, but alſo on your Veſſel, and examine your Oyl, as well as mind your light. For though you have received an <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction from the Holy One,</hi> and felt the ſweet influences of the Spirit, and have had the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in your ſelf, yet the Comforter, which ſometimes relieved your Soul, may (at the preſent) be far from you, and ſuſpend his teſtimony; for Grace inherent is not ſelf-enlightning, but like the Moon, which holdeth forth Light no longer than the Sun ſhineth upon it; and though the Diall hath its Lines and Figures, to declare the time of the day, yet you will be to ſeek, if the Sun withdraw hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Light: Even thus, though the Spirit of God hath drawn the Lines and Figures of his Gifts and Graces in your heart, yet if he alſo do not ſhine upon them, you will not know what time of day it is with your Soul. Pray therefore and ſtrive for renewed ſights of Grace, and for anointing with freſh Oyl; for the Saints do often loſe their Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions through careleſneſs and inadvertency, whileſt they have here and there to do, or indulgence to ſome Carnality, and through the malignancy of ſome over beating temper or temptation in an <hi>hour and power of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> And this makes the Soul to <hi>drive heavily,</hi> which ſometimes ran as plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly
<pb n="780" facs="tcp:95740:401"/> as the <hi>Chariots</hi> of <hi>Aminadib,</hi> but now the Wheels begin to skreek, through want of freſh anointings.</p>
            <p>It being ſo, look to your Veſſels and your Oil, and ſee how they are ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with it and how the Spirit ſhineth at any time upon his own Lines and Figures. This alſo I premiſe to the anſwer of the Queſtion, becauſe the ſoul never acteth Grace ſo vigorouſly as vvhen ones ſtate is cleared.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> therefore for reſolution; Maintain your Faith in frequent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and make no leſs conſcience of acting daily Faith, than you do of daily Prayer. For we are apt to reſt in a <hi>quondam</hi> Call to Chriſt, and in the original work of Faith, and not to be coming ſtill to Chriſt; and that as earneſtly and ſtudiouſly as if we had never come before. <hi>He that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>John</hi> 6.35. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. The word in the Original is a Participle of the Preſent Tenſe. And through the neglect of this daily coming the ſoul is often in the dark, and ſeemeth to have loſt the Promiſe in which it was formerly drawn to Chriſt; by means whereof, it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times midnight with the wiſeſt Virgins, as well as ſo at other times, by means of their ſecurity. For inſtance; <hi>By Faith,</hi> Abraham, <hi>when he was called,</hi> not only unto <hi>Canaan,</hi> but unto <hi>Chriſt, obeyed;</hi> for he <hi>looked more</hi> to the <hi>Promiſed Seed,</hi> than to the <hi>Promiſed Land,</hi> elſe, what had his Faith been? But now in tract of time (<hi>viz.</hi> about ten years after) he begins to call the Promiſe into queſtion, <hi>Gen.</hi> 15.2. and to make the <hi>Steward of his houſe his Heir,</hi> till God renewed the Promiſe, to revive thereby the actings of his ſleeping Faith; <hi>Look now towards Heaven,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them,</hi> and he ſaid unto him, <hi>ſo ſhall thy Seed be:</hi> Upon this, <hi>Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was accounted to him for righteouſneſs.</hi> Why? Did he not believe before? Yes, The Apoſtle dateth his Faith from his coming out of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>r</hi> of the <hi>Caldees Heb.</hi> 11.8. And yet here we meet with a ſecond Date, <hi>i. e.</hi> as to an eminent reviving act of his Faith, as if he had omitted to believe, as indeed he did, and now began again, which was only an interruption, not an interciſion.</p>
            <p>Now thus it may be with you who believed many years ago; but the Promiſe and Impreſſion of it is perhaps almoſt worn out, and your Faith begins to languiſh; but the Promiſe is ſtill the ſame; and <hi>the word of the Lord endureth for ever,</hi> and that is the word of the Goſpel which is preached to you; wherefore take hold of it again and again, and of Chriſt therein; and not only of that particular promiſe wherein Chriſt at firſt was held out unto you, but of any other that occurreth; and in the frequent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newings of your Faith, your drooping hearts will be revived, and long at laſt for the coming of him in whom your Soul believeth. You know that your Faith will determine with your Life, and therefore improve it daily for your Death, which draweth on by gradual ſteps, in which you are ſtill making forwards towards the Bridegroom's coming, who keeps equal paces with you; ſo that he and you will meet together at the point of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution: Your Faith cannot conquer Death: for there is no diſcharge in that war between Death and Nature; only Faith will vanquiſh the dread and horror of it. For Death (in which the Bridegroom firſt cometh to us) is, in it ſelf, <hi>the King of Terrors;</hi> other Afflictions (as Poverty, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach,
<pb n="771" facs="tcp:95740:401"/> Impriſonment, Debt, Exile, Sickneſs, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) are inferiour fears, which poſſibly may be eſcaped, and out of which there is oftentimes deliverance; but Death is the Soveraign Lord and King of all of them, from whence there is no return. He that goeth down to the Grave, ſhall come up no more, but paſſeth preſently unto the higheſt Tribunal, there to receive the eternal judgment, whether of Abſolution, or of Condemnation. And upon this account, the fear of the King of Terrors, is the King of Fears, and a ſore and painful bondage, in which many are held all their Life-time, till Faith in Chriſt releaſe them; yea, and afterwards alſo, if their Faith be not the ſtronger. What ſhall I ſay then, but, <hi>Awake Faith,</hi> and flee to him for refuge, <hi>who through death hath deſtroyed him that hath the power of Death, that is the Devil; and delivered them, who through fear of Death were all their life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time ſubject unto bondage.</hi> For without this Refuge of Faith, Chriſt's coming by Death, is terrible and aſtoniſhing, which the bare habit of Faith cannot cure and conquer. Believe therefore that you are Chriſt's, and believe it daily by frequent cloſings with him, and reſignations of your ſelves unto him, and then you are not ſo much Death's, as Death is yours, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.22, 23. Make good your intereſt in the Bridegroom, and then you will rejoice at his coming; <hi>Make haſte, my Beloved,</hi> ſaith the Bride, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8. <hi>ult.</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe he is <hi>Beloved,</hi> and <hi>my Beloved. And the Spirit and the Bride ſay Come,</hi> Rev. 22.17. <hi>i. e.</hi> The Spirit in the Bride, or the Spirit of the Bride: for a Bride hath a Bride-like Spirit, which longeth for the coming of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. But perhaps the weak Believer cannot reach to ſay thus; and therefore ſaith the Bridegroom to him, <hi>Let him that is athirſt come;</hi> If thou canſt not ſay <hi>Come,</hi> to me, I ſay, <hi>Come,</hi> to thee: For we muſt firſt <hi>come</hi> to Chriſt, before we can ſay <hi>Come,</hi> to him; yea, we muſt have ſome ſenſe of our <hi>coming</hi> unto him, before we can heartily ſay, <hi>Come,</hi> to h m. And this Faith that I have ſpoken of, is the principal Grace, preparing the Believer for the coming of Chriſt, provided that it be maintained in frequent exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; for hereby the Perſon is juſtified, the Heart purified, the Conſcience pacified, a ſweet Correſpondence continued between Chriſt and the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Soul, Death conquered, and Heaven opened.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> This Faith doth neceſſarily work by Love, and as they always do co-operate, ſo are they commenſurate, and carry a juſt proportion each to other, though peradventure you may be more ſenſible of your Love, than of your Faith. But now, the more you abound in both, the more you will long for the coming of Chriſt, and be the more prepared for it. No marvel therefore that the Apoſtle loved the appearance of Chriſt, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. with <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. who had ſo great a love to his perſon, that <hi>he was not only ready to be bound, but to dye at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for the Name of the Lord Jeſus. To dye at Jeruſalem,</hi> for there (he remembred) Chriſt died for him. And this en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flameth his love towards him, and makes him willing to dye for him, and to be for ever with him. No marvel alſo, that he was ſtraightned between the choice of Life and Death, and that the balance ſeemed to incline moſtly towards departure and being with Chriſt. He crieth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1 23. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>I am conſtrained between two:</hi> Why ſo? Becauſe he could ſay, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>; <hi>The love of Chriſt (i. e.</hi> to ſerve him with all my might) <hi>conſtraineth me.</hi> The Original word is the ſame in both places.</p>
            <pb n="772" facs="tcp:95740:402"/>
            <p>And how came <hi>Peter</hi> to ſleep ſo ſoundly and ſweetly in his chains be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Souldiers, the night before his intended death, in which he was to go to Chriſt? Why, he could ſay, <hi>Lord, thou knoweſt all things, thou knoweſt that I love thee,</hi> John 21.17. When Chriſt lieth in the Embraces of Faith and Love, what followeth next but <hi>Nunc dimittis?</hi> How ſo? Thus; The more we are purified, the more prepared. Now as the heart is purified by Faith, ſo alſo by Love; For <hi>herein is our Love made perfect, that we may have boldneſs in the day of Judgment; becauſe as he is, ſo are we in this world,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.17. Love doth aſſimilate a godly Soul to Chriſt; and then what follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth? <hi>There is no fear in Love,</hi> 1 John 4.18. <hi>i. e.</hi> no fear of the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for <hi>perfect Love</hi> caſteth out fear, <hi>i. e.</hi> ſtrong Love; for ſo is <hi>perfect</hi> ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken ſometimes, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.20. <hi>In underſtanding be men,</hi> or perfect; <hi>i. e.</hi> ſtrong, and not like Children. So <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. So that ſtrong Love caſteth out the fear of the day of Judgment, which every degree of Love will not do; for <hi>he that feareth is not made perfect in love:</hi> he may have a true ſincere love, but it is too weak to overcome his tormenting fears about that great and terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble day of the Lord. Be much therefore in the exerciſe of this Grace, keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your ſelf in the love of God, and <hi>looking for the Mercy of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt unto eternal Life:</hi> and be often in the contemplation of the preventing love of God and Chriſt; to which <hi>John</hi> in the foreſaid place directeth us for the ſtrengthning of Faith,<note place="margin">Amat ille non immerito qui amatus eſt ſine merito. <hi>Bern.</hi>
               </note> and overcoming our fears: ſaith he, <hi>We love him, becauſe he loved us firſt,</hi> 1 John 4.19. And Chriſt is deſervedly beloved of him, who is undeſervedly beloved of Chriſt. And though there is a force in <hi>Anathema Maranatha,</hi> to put the Soul upon the love of Chriſt, yet be taken rather with, <hi>Grace be with all them that love him in ſincerity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Valdè ſunt cognatae ſoro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res Fides &amp; Spes, <hi>D. Par. in</hi> Heb. <hi>6.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As Faith and Love are co-operary, ſo Faith and Love are very near of kin; only <hi>Hope</hi> is the younger Siſter, as to operation, as waiting with patience for that good which faith laieth claim to in the promiſe; and without this Hope we can neither live nor dye with comfort. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is many times deferred as to accompliſhment; and without hope's pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, how will you ſpend the interval? God made a promiſe to <hi>Abraham</hi> of multiplying his Seed, but neither he, nor yet <hi>Iſaac,</hi> nor <hi>Jacob</hi> muſt live to ſee it fulfilled. But ſaith <hi>Stephen, When the time of the promiſe drew near, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,</hi> ſo that God's promiſes have their ſtated times and ſeaſons, during which, there is work for hope, or elſe the Soul would ſwoon away. <hi>My ſoul</hi> (ſaith <hi>David) fainteth for thy Salvation, but I hope in thy word,</hi> Pſal. 119.81. <hi>i. e.</hi> thy word of Promiſe. Hope is a Cordial a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Soul's fainting fits.</p>
            <p>Again; During this interſpace between the promiſe and the accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you may meet with many tribulations, thorow which you muſt enter into the Kingdom of heaven, fightings without, &amp; fears within, the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men may ſmite you, and the keepers of the walls may take away your Vail, as if you were no Virgin, but a Proſtitute, you may meet with ſad eclipſes, and the hidings of God's face, his wrath may lye hard upon you, and all his waves afflict you; nay, you may meet ſometimes with ſuch a ſtorm, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sun nor Stars may in many days appear; during which time, you may reel to and fro like a drunken man, and be at your wits end; your tackling
<pb n="773" facs="tcp:95740:402"/> and fraught may be thrown overboard with your own hands, you may call all the work of God in you into queſtion, and your hull may be laid a drift either to ſink or ſwim. In theſe, and the like caſes, what will you do without caſting the Anchor of your Hope within the vail, and riding it out till Sun and Stars appear again? O let the patience of hope have its <hi>perfect work,</hi> for you will have great need hereof, that when you have <hi>done the will of God, you may receive the Promiſe.</hi> Though the wiſe Virgins fell aſleep, yet ſo far as they waited for Chriſt's coming, they exerciſed their hope; and ſuch can ſay at the Coming of Chriſt, <hi>Loe this is our God, we have waited for him, and he will ſave us: This is the Lord, we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoyce in his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Keep even accounts with God, and ſtill be perfecting that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance which is the work of every day, and let there be no old reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings between God and you; for ſo it may be with a true Believer, and it may be called to his remembrance in an evil day, and lye heavy too upon his Conſcience. For this (I conceive) was <hi>Jacob's</hi> caſe, who had ſinned greatly in his fraudulent and ſurreptitious way of getting the Bleſſing from his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> for which he was not thorowly awaked to ſee the evil of it, for the ſpace of twenty years; namely, at his return from <hi>Padan Aram,</hi> and that <hi>Eſau</hi> was coming forth againſt him to be revenged on him; but then his ſin came freſh to his remembrance, and he ſet apart a night to ſeek the Lord by ſolemn Prayer, and to wreſtle with the Angel of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant. And what did he wreſtle with him for? You may ſee by his Anſwer to the Angel, <hi>I will not let thee go without a bleſſing,</hi> Gen. 32.26. Why, did not his Father bleſs him? Yes; <hi>I have bleſſed him,</hi> ſaith he to <hi>Eſau; yea, and he ſhall be bleſſed, Gen.</hi> 27.33. And not only ſo, but when <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſent him to <hi>Padan-Aram,</hi> he bleſſed him again, <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.1. But <hi>Jacob</hi> would not truſt to this, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the firſt and chief bleſſing (which was due to him by Oracle and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe) had an ill foundation, as to the manner of obtaining it, and in that reſpect there vvas a flavv in the Title, vvhich therefore novv he ſtriveth to corroborate, before he dares to look his Brother <hi>Eſau</hi> in the face; as if he ſhould ſay, My Father indeed hath bleſſed me, but there vvas <hi>Error per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonae,</hi> he miſtook the perſon, and therefore the Bleſſing is null; and more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, what the meaning of this Providence is, that my Brother ſhould come forth againſt me in this hoſtile manner, I knovv not: Wherefore I humbly beg thy Bleſſing, and the confirmation of that Title vvhich hath ſo great an error in it.</p>
            <p>Thus God brought an old reckoning to his remembrance in an evil day, and ſet it on his conſcience, and put him to repent and mourn; for <hi>he wept and made ſupplication to the Angel,</hi> Hoſ. 12.4. He came not off ſo eaſily, but was fain to vvreſtle hard all night, to loſe his reſt, and to ſtruggle, and ſweat, and pray, and vveep, and ſhed many a tear, and to go halting aftervvard up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Thigh unto his dying day.</p>
            <p>Take heed therefore of old Reckonings undiſcharged; look back and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider hovv it hath been, and omit not a day vvithout revievving your Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Repentings; I ſay, as duly as the day determineth: let not the Sun go dovvn upon any guilt contracted, that ſo <hi>your ſins may be blotted out when
<pb n="774" facs="tcp:95740:403"/> the times of refreſhing ſhall come from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> and exerciſe your ſelf to <hi>have always a Conſcience void of offence towards God and men;</hi> and this vvill the better prepare you for the coming of Jeſus Chriſt both by Death and Judgment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Be much in the exerciſe of Goodneſs, Mercy, and works of Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality towards Chriſt in his needy Members, according to your opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and power. For though you ſhall be ſaved by your <hi>Faith,</hi> yet you ſhall be judged <hi>according to your Works.</hi> And it greatly concerneth us, to be labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious in that Service upon vvhich the judgment ſhall paſs at Chriſt's appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.35, 36. Call your ſelf therefore to an account what you have done in this way for Chriſt, as how you have fed, cloathed, viſited, relieved him in his Members here on earth. And if this were more conſidered, ſuch as profeſs to Chriſt, would be more active for him in ought wherein they might be more ſerviceable to him; but when we ſee but little activity in the exerciſe of this Grace, we may well fear there is but little Oil in the Veſſel; for rich anointings will make men agile and ready for every good work, inaſmuch as <hi>the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodneſs,</hi> and they that hope for eternal Life when Chriſt ſhall come by Death and Judgment, muſt <hi>ſeek for Glory, Honour and Immortality,</hi> not only in well-doing, but in continuance in it. Beware of Omiſſions, and among others, of this great duty. The Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will reach unto all ſins,<note place="margin">In the Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of his Life and Death</note> and to omiſſions in a ſpecial manner, <hi>Mat.</hi> 25.37, 38. For which, that learned and holy <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſher</hi> was humbled upon his death-bed.</p>
            <p>The Nobleman hath put a Pound into your hand, ſaying. <hi>Occupy till I come;</hi> yea, he hath given you many Pounds in a literal ſenſe, with which you muſt trade, as well as with the Talents of your Parts and Gifts of Grace: And I know you would be glad to <hi>find Mercy</hi> with <hi>Oneſiphorus, in the day of Chriſt;</hi> Remember therefore, <hi>Bleſſed are the merciful, for they ſhall obtain mercy,</hi> Mat. 5.7. But, <hi>He ſhall have judgment without mercy, who hath ſhewed no mercy,</hi> whereas <hi>mercy rejoyceth againſt judgment.</hi> A merciful man is ſo far from fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgment at Chriſt's coming, that he rather rejoyceth at the thoughts of it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Exerciſe diligence and faithfulneſs in your particular Calling. For when Chriſt ſpeaketh of his Coming, ſaith he, <hi>Be ye ready, for in ſuch an hour as ye think not, the Son of man cometh.</hi> What followeth? <hi>Who then is a faithful and wiſe ſervant, whom his Lord hath made Ruler over his houſhold, to give them meat in due ſeaſon? Bleſſed is that ſervant, whom his Lord when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, ſhall find ſo doing,</hi> Mat. 24.44, 45, 46. When Chriſt was ſpeaking to this Point, ſaith <hi>Peter, Lord, ſpeakeſt thou this Parable to us, or even unto all? Luke</hi> 12.41. Truly Chriſt ſpake it unto all, though in a ſpecial manner to ſuch as <hi>Peter;</hi> for Chriſt will have an account how every one of us have mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged our particular Callings. But they that are Stewards in the Houſe of God, which is his Church, have a very great account to give; and it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them in a ſpecial manner, <hi>that a man be found faithful;</hi> and of all Chriſt's ſervants, his Stewards have moſt to anſwer for; that if a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of the Goſpel, and the care of ſouls were not committed to them, he that underſtandeth the weight of Stewardſhip, would dread to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake
<pb n="775" facs="tcp:95740:403"/> it; but a neceſſity is laid upon them, and <hi>wo unto them if they Preach not the Goſpel.</hi> It is ſaid of <hi>Calvin,</hi> that when Nature began to decline in him,<note place="margin">Melch. Adam <hi>in vit.</hi> Calv.</note> and the ſymptoms of a dying man appeared on him, he would be diligent at his Studies, from which his friends diſſwading him, ſaith he, <hi>Nunquid me Dominus inveniet otioſum?</hi> Shall my Maſter find me idle? Let ſuch therefore, and all be diligent and faithful in their reſpective place; and employments: And indeed every man is a Steward more or leſs. You know what the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſaith of the ſlothful Servant, <hi>Take him and caſt him into outer darkneſs, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth.</hi> Such ſlothful ſervants ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the tribute of eternal pains, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12.24. when <hi>the good and faithful Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant ſhall be made ruler over many things, and enter into the joy of his Lord,</hi> Mat. 25.23. Would you ſtand before Chriſt at his coming? Oh dread Idleneſs and unfaithfulneſs in your Callings, as you deſire to be ſound of him in peace, at his appearance! Fill up your days with Duty, and give your time to him who gave it to you. <hi>Paul</hi> was a great lover of Chriſt and his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance, and who more abundant in his Labours for him? For he had the Conſcience of his indefatigable induſtry and fidelity in his work for his Maſter. Saith he, <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the Faith,</hi> 2 Tim 4.7, 8. He meaneth eſpecially his military faith and oath in fighting a good fight for Chriſt. And wherefore do we hear him groaning ſo earneſtly, deſiring to be <hi>cloathed upon with his houſe which is from Heaven?</hi> It was becauſe he laboured <hi>ambitiouſly,</hi> that <hi>whether preſent or abſent, he might be accepted of him; For,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>We muſt all appear before the Judgment-Seat of Chriſt, that every one might receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad,</hi> 2 Cor. 5 2. with 9.10.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly,</hi> That I might not multiply particulars, let me add what Chriſt hath joined together; <hi>Sobriety, Watchfulneſs</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Luk. 21 34.36.</note> And therefore <hi>take heed to your ſelves, leſt at any time your hearts be overcharged with ſurfetting and drunkenneſs, and cares of this Life, and that Day come upon you unawares. Gird up therefore the loins of your minds, be ſober, and hope to the end for the Grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt; for we are dead, and our life is hid with Chriſt in God, and when Chriſt who is our Life ſhall appear, then ſhall we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in Glory with him. Mortifie therefore your earthly Members, Fornication, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, inordinate Affections, evil Concupiſcence, and Covetouſneſs, which is Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry.</hi> You muſt not only deny all viſible groſs ungodlineſs, which even the very Sons of Morality will decline and decay; but alſo all worldly luſts, and their ſecret operations, living <hi>ſoberly, righteouſly and godly in this preſent world, looking for that bleſſed hope and glorious appearance of the great God, and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Take heed of ſlumbring in theſe ſecret luſts, <hi>for ye are children of the light and of the day, and therefore take heed that you ſleep not as o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers do, but watch and be ſober, for they that ſleep, ſleep in the night, and they that are drunk, are drunk in the night; but let us who are of the day, be ſober, putting on the Breaſt plate of Faith and Love, and for an Helmet, the hope of ſalvation, watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and praying always, that ye may be accounted worthy to eſcape thoſe things which</hi> ſhall befall the fooliſh Virgins, <hi>and that ye may ſtand before the Son of man, who is coming with ten thouſand of his Saints to execute Judgment upon all; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be ſober, and watch unto Prayer, ſeeing the end of all things is at hand;</hi> and
<pb n="776" facs="tcp:95740:404"/> look well to your Lamps, which are your Watch-lights, that they burn brightly in this World's Midnight, and pray particularly for daily ſupplies of Oil, and ſincerity in all your Actions and Duties both to God and man; never omitting to beg for Death-bed-Grace that ſo you may live and die to the honour of your Bridegroom. And as for this preſent World, <hi>uſe it as if you uſed it not,</hi> and have no more to do with it than bare need requireth: And ſet your Hearts and Houſes, and all your civil ſecular Affairs in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, <hi>having your converſations in Heaven, whence you look for Chriſt the Saviour.</hi> And thus walking with God in the exerciſe of theſe gifts of Grace, when we come to dye, we ſhall change our places only, but not our company. And let none of you behold Death at a diſtance, nor have it ſeldom in your thoughts, but daily in your eye, that you may not fear it when it cometh. A Lion is not terrible to his Keeper that ſeeth him every day. You muſt frequently converſe with God, Chriſt, Death and Judgment. For when Chriſt ſpeaketh of his coming to Judgment, he ſo expreſſeth it, as if he were to come in their time to whom he ſpake it, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24 42. <hi>Mark</hi> 13.33.35, 36, 37. <hi>Luke</hi> 21.34, 35, 36. And ſo indeed he did; for he comes to every man at the hour of his Diſſolution. And we are his Agents or Factors in a foreign Land, and how ſoon he may remind us home, and call us to an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we know not. Say not therefore, <hi>My Lord delayeth his coming;</hi> leſt we are thereby rocked into a midnight ſleep, and ſcared with a midnight-cry of, <hi>Behold the Bridegroom cometh, go ye out to meet him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall not detain you much longer. You have heard <hi>what thoſe Graces are, which are chiefly to be exerciſed in order to an actual preparation for the coming of Christ by Death and Judgment.</hi> I now commend them to your daily exerciſe; and for your encouragement therein, ſhall leave a few Conſiderations with you, and conclude.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That the Door of eternal Reſt and Glory ſhall ſtand open for you at Chriſt's coming to you by Death. Why?</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe you are <hi>ready;</hi> and they that are <hi>ready,</hi> go in with the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom. God hath made you <hi>meet to be partakers of the inheritance with the Saints in light,</hi> Col. 1.12. and <hi>hath wrought you for the ſelf ſame thing,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.5. You are a Veſſel of <hi>Mercy prepared for Glory,</hi> Rom. 9.23.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You admitted Chriſt into the door of your hearts, when there <hi>he ſtood and knocked,</hi> Rev. 3.20.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Conſider the place into which you ſhall be admitted; for the wiſe Virgins ſhall enter into the King's Palace, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.14, 15. into Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe, the third Heavens, your Father's Houſe, <hi>a City that hath foundations, whoſe Builder and Maker is God,</hi> Heb. 11.10.

This is the place whither you ſhall enter.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> You ſhall enter thither with the Bridegroom, even our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and this is heaven enough, <hi>viz.</hi> to be where Chriſt is, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.42, 43. <hi>John</hi> 14.3. &amp; 17.24. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 4.17. Heaven is deſcribed by being with Chriſt. And when Chriſt ſhall deſcend from heaven with a ſhout, to judge the world, if all the Saints (ſuppoſe) ſhould not deſcend with him, but any of them be left behind, what an alteration would they find in heaven? whereas all of them going with Chriſt, it is all one as if they were ſtill in heaven with him. You know <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>caught up into the third heavens,</hi> and yet when he comes to deſcribe heaven, and the Saints e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verlaſting happineſs there, he calls it <hi>being for ever with Chriſt:</hi> for this is a comprehenſive expreſſion. How ſo?</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the Saints ſhall be with Chriſt, then ſhall they be exempt from all troubles and trials; theſe fall off from them like <hi>Elijah's</hi> Mantle, when he went to heaven. There is now a glorious door of partition between theſe and them, they are all excluded, <hi>viz.</hi> Sin, Sorrow, Afflictions, Reproaches, Neceſſities, Perſecutions, Poverty, Sickneſs, Pain, Death, Curſe, wicked men and Devils; you ſhall never be troubled with theſe any more.</p>
            <p n="2">2. If they enter in with Chriſt, they ſhall enjoy the Father in him, <hi>John</hi> 20.17. and be filled with the Holy Ghoſt from them both, and thereby with unſpeakable conſolations, and the fulneſs of God, and they ſhall live for ever in the immediate contemplation, and viſion and fruition of one God in three perſons, and be repleniſhed to the brim with eternal love from them and to them.</p>
            <p n="3">3. You ſhall enjoy the fellowſhip of an innumerable company of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, and ſhall then know who they are, and love them entirely, and be as intimately beloved of them, though now in your preſent ſtate you cannot bear the preſence of one of them.</p>
            <p n="4">4. You ſhall <hi>ſit down with Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> and enjoy communion with the <hi>Spirits of juſt men made perfect,</hi> Heb. 12.23. All this followeth from your entrance into Heaven with Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Conſider that you ſhall enter into Heaven with Chriſt the Bridegroom, and therefore to be married to him. And hence again it will follow,</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there will be the neareſt relation poſſible between Chriſt and you; for you ſhall be one conjugally for ever with him. You are one with him myſtically and matrimonially, who is one with the Father eſſentially.</p>
            <p n="2">2. You ſhall be inveſted with unutterable Glory, ſeeing it is a Marriage-time, wherein the Bridegroom and Bride ſhall ſhine in the richeſt Attire and Embroidery that is in all the Wardrobe of Heaven. Chriſt and the Saints ſhall wear the very ſame Glory, <hi>John</hi> 17.22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. There ſhall be unconceivable Love, Joy, Delight and Complacency between the Bridegrom and the Bride; and <hi>as the Bridegroom rejoyceth over the Bride,</hi> ſo ſhall the Lord Jeſus rejoyce over his Spouſe. O there will be a moſt glorious, delightful, loving, ſweet familiarity and conjugal rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing between Chriſt Jeſus and the Saints! Marriage-joy upon earth is uſually great, what then will that be in heaven, when ſhall be fulfilled th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

                  <pb n="778" facs="tcp:95740:407"/> until the day that I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom,</hi> Mat. 26.29. Where, by <hi>fruit of the Vine,</hi> we underſtand <hi>Wine, which maketh glad the heart of man,</hi> Pſal. 104 15. and cauſeth it to rejoyce, and ſhadoweth out the Love of Chriſt, and Joys of Heaven to us; <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.2, 4. And by <hi>New,</hi> we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>other,</hi> Mark 16.17. with <hi>Acts</hi> 2.4. in the Original. So that in this Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage there ſhall be new, <hi>i. e.</hi> other (yea, othergeſs) wine, <hi>viz.</hi> Love, Joy and Rejoycing, than there is in the Lord's Supper; For Chriſt, who kept the beſt wine to the laſt at the Marriage in <hi>Cana in Galilee,</hi> will ſurely do ſo at his own Marriage at the laſt day.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This Marriage is not on Earth, but in Heaven, and therefore it ſhall never diſſolve, as Marriages on Earth do, but continue unto Eternity. O how will the Holy Angels rejoice and ſing at this Marriage! For they that ſang at the Birth of Chriſt when he lay in the Manger, will ſing to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe at his Marriage, when he ſitteth upon his Throne in the higheſt Glory.</p>
            <p>Now the conſideration of theſe things is greatly inducing to be very ſtudious in actual preparations for the coming of Chriſt. Be ye therefore much in the exerciſe of Faith, Hope, Love, Repentance, Goodneſs, Mercy, and works of Bounty, Diligence and Faithfulneſs in your Callings, Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Watchfulneſs and Prayer, that ſo at laſt you may have an entrance mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred unto you abundantly into the everlaſting Kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And now, Brethren, Abide in him, that when he ſhall appear, you may have confidence, and not be aſhamed before him at his coming; but lift up your heads with joy unſpeakable and full of Glory. Hear wiſdom there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and receive inſtruction, that you may be wiſe in the latter end. And God himſelf and our Father, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt make you to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in all theſe Preparatory Graces, to the end that he may eſtabliſh your hearts unblameable in Holineſs before God, even our Father, at the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt with all his Saints. And now, Grace be with all them that love him in ſincerity. <hi>Amen.</hi>
